Long story short, although I knew about my product, I got absolutely cooked by the pressure. It was quite embarassing, I got super nervous, I tried my best to keep composure, but overall I realized that the problem wasn’t knowledge, it was in-the-moment execution.\nSo I decided to swallow my pride and switched strategy to do online sales calls. I was tired of reading countless of sales books which I felt like didn't rly help. Instead, I found a practice + live-call helper (not naming it here to avoid breaking rules) that did two things really well:\n\t•\tgave me short cues when I stalled (clarify, label, ask X), and\n\t•\tforced focused reps every day (recorded, reviewed, improved next day).\nSoon I started booking actual small online calls, then bigger ones. Now I am closing several B2B clients (names confidental) in the real estate niche, and it's night and day difference I feel like from when I started out. I'm not pretending to be some prodigy, I'm just a guy who practiced smartly and got the reps in.\n \nIf anyone’s curious what specifically helped (drills, cue types, review cadence), I’m happy to break it down. If mods allow, I can share a 10-sec GIF of how I practiced, otherwise I’ll DM the details/tools. Not selling anything, just sharing what finally got me unstuck.\nEdit (results): After around 12-14 weeks of daily reps + live calls, I’m consistently at low five figures/month from B2B projects (which for my age is relatively quite a bit).

[i will not promote]","body":"I'm in the pre-launch trenches with my next SaaS, and wanted to share a counter-intuitive experiment that's completely changed my GTM strategy.\n\nLike many of you, I was doing a ton of manual cold outreach. The soul-crushing 1-2% reply rate was brutal. Worse, the 98% silence gave me zero data. Are they not interested? Bad timing? Did my email even land? My open/click rates were useless vanity metrics.\n\n**My hypothesis: The biggest friction in cold outreach isn't the ask, it's the effort of replying.** No one wants to write a polite \"no, thanks\" to a stranger.\n\nSo, I ran a test. Instead of optimizing for a \"Yes\", I decided to optimize for a **clear signal**. I built a simple tool to replace the \"Book a demo\" CTA with one-click response links.\n\n**The Setup (400+ emails and LInkedin DMs, 50/50):**\n\nInstead of asking for a meeting, I asked one simple question:\n\n\"Is solving \\[Problem X\\] a priority for you this quarter? Click or reply with a number\n\n1. Yes\n2. No\"\n\n**The Results:**\n\n* **13.6% Reply Rate.** I got 54 structured responses. It felt like turning on the lights in a dark room. I finally had data.\n* **The \"No's\" were the real gold.** The majority of replies were \"No\". This was the most valuable part. It allowed me to instantly disqualify leads and clean my pipeline, saving me what would have been dozens of hours on pointless follow-ups.\n* **It turned \"No\" into a positive outcome.** Instead of feeling rejected, I felt efficient.\n\nThis small shift has been a game-changer. I'm now obsessed with turning that 98% of silence into a structured dataset. It feels like a much more sustainable and respectful way to build a pipeline and actually learn from the market.\n\nJust wanted to share this data point.

Your users are already creating valuable content with your product, but you're making it way too hard for them to share it.\n\n**The 2-minute audit that reveals everything:**\n\n1. Go create something valuable in your product right now\n2. Try to share it with someone external\n3. Count every single step required\n\nIf it takes more than 2 clicks, you're hemorrhaging potential viral growth.\n\nI just ran this audit with a design tool startup. Their users were creating these incredible mockups and presentations, but sharing required:\n\n* Export to PDF\n* Download to computer\n* Upload to email/Slack\n* Add context manually\n\n7 steps. No wonder their viral coefficient was 0.02.\n\nWe rebuilt their sharing flow to 2 clicks with automatic context. Viral coefficient jumped to 0.31 in 6 weeks.\n\n**Here's the framework I use:**\n\n**Week 1: Value Output Inventory** Map everything your users create. Rate each output 1-10 on shareability. Focus on anything scoring 7+.\n\n**Week 2: Viral Moment Detection** Find when users naturally want to show off results. Track where they currently share. Map the emotional triggers.\n\n**Week 3-4: Friction Elimination** This is where most companies fail. Count every click, every step, every friction point in sharing valuable outputs.\n\n**Week 5-6: Network Effect Integration** Build features that get more valuable when others join. Collaboration tools, shared workspaces, public galleries.\n\n**Ongoing: Track What Matters**\n\n* Viral coefficient (shared outputs → signups)\n* Collaboration invite conversion\n* External share volume\n* User-generated content reach\n\nThe AI opportunity is massive here. Your users are creating presentations and analyses that showcase your tool's capability to their entire network. But 94% of B2B companies make this sharing process painful.\n\nAnyone else seeing similar patterns in their products?

{"id":"1n8jzih","title":"one of the most common mistakes i keep seeing startup founders make early on (i will not promote)","body":"one of the most common mistakes i’ve been seeing lately from startup founders, especially those just starting out, is letting excitement override clear thinking. as soon as they find someone willing to help build an MVP and work on the idea, they rush to call them a co-founder, even if that person has a full-time or part-time job elsewhere and can’t fully commit.\n\nin the beginning, everything feels built on friendship, trust, and big promises like \"don’t worry, we’re brothers, we’re building a dream, we don’t need to get into details now.\" but in reality, that approach is a legal time bomb that can affect the company’s entire future, from funding all the way to exit.\n\nthe first issue usually comes from the partner’s existing employment contracts. they might have signed a non-compete or an NDA, and that opens the door for their employer to claim that any intellectual property created for the startup actually belongs to them, since the partner was still on their payroll at the time.\n\nthis risk becomes even more serious when investors get involved. during legal due diligence, if they find that the startup’s code or core algorithms could be subject to ownership disputes, they’ll demand indemnification clauses to protect themselves. in that case, the main founder could end up personally liable for problems they didn’t create.\n\nthe second critical issue is equity. it doesn’t make sense to hand a part-time partner a large share from day one. equity should be tied to commitment through a vesting schedule, with a \"cliff\" period before they receive any actual shares. otherwise, you could end up with someone who leaves after a year but still holds a significant chunk of the cap table, which is a red flag for investors.\n\nanother essential safeguard is intellectual property assignment. any work, code, or prototypes developed for the startup, even on personal devices, must be legally transferred to the company. adding a \"work for hire\" clause is equally important, as it protects the startup if someone is working elsewhere at the same time, preventing future ownership disputes.\n\na conflict-of-interest clause is also critical. if a partner has another job, they need to commit that confidential information from their employer will never be mixed with startup work.\n\nso what’s the right approach? should a founder avoid working with someone who has another job?\n\nnot at all. in fact, having such partners can be valuable, especially if they bring expertise you need. the key is to put everything in writing through a strong founders’ agreement. it should cover ip assignment, vesting, NDA, non-solicitation, clear time commitments, and indemnification to protect the company in case of disputes with their employer.\n\na smart founder treats legal stuff with the same attention as product and market strategy. it might not seem urgent at first, but ignoring it can easily sink your startup.\n\n","author":{"name":"boulhouech"},"score":21,"numComments":8,"subreddit":{"display_name":"startups"},"permalink":"/r/startups/comments/1n8jzih/one_of_the_most_common_mistakes_i_keep_seeing/","createdUtc":1757014797,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1n8jzih/one_of_the_most_common_mistakes_i_keep_seeing/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895608552,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

I’m building an iOS app.\n\nI *really* don’t want to be locked into Mapbox or Google’s APIs because their free tiers are tiny, the costs spike way too fast, and honestly we’d outgrow them before even seeing revenue. So I’ve been experimenting with self-hosted routing engines like OSRM, Valhalla, and GraphHopper.\n\nHere’s the reality though:\n\n* **OSRM** → super fast, but preprocessing North America or planet-wide data keeps OOM-killing my 48 GB RAM + 256 GB swap VPS. I’ve filtered down to drivable roads only, made progress, but it still dies halfway through.\n* **Valhalla** → love the feature set, but tile builds are huge, and I’m not sure if it’s the smartest choice for worldwide coverage without serious hardware.\n* **GraphHopper** → Java-based, and also pretty RAM-hungry for imports. Seems solid, but maybe better suited for regional extracts.\n\nI’m at a crossroads (pun intended 😅). I need:\n\n* Worldwide or at least North America coverage\n* Car routing only (don’t care about bikes/walkers)\n* Polyline + step-by-step directions I can overlay on Mapbox maps and feed into CarPlay\n* Something that won’t bankrupt me before launch\n\nI’ve also looked at hosted APIs (Google, HERE, TomTom, etc.) but they get expensive real quick. Ideally, I’d love to find a partner service that works with early-stage startups or an open-source stack that’s lighter on preprocessing.\n\nSo I guess my questions are:\n\n* Has anyone here solved this at startup scale without burning crazy $$$?\n* Are there routing providers who actually *partner* with small apps to give better terms?\n* Or am I better off sharding (e.g., NA/EU/Asia) and reverse-proxying multiple self-hosted OSRM/Valhalla builds?\n\nAny advice, war stories, or “here’s what worked for us” would be amazing.

{"id":"1neyixl","title":"Cold outreach won’t work for your startup. Here’s why [I will not promote]","body":"I talk to a lot of startup founders: clients, friends, people I meet at events, and many of them say the same thing: \"We tried cold outreach. It didn’t really work for us.\"\n\nSo I ask: what did you actually try?\n\nAnd 9 times out of 10, when you start digging into details, it’s something like this:\n\n* A list of 100 people from different industries\n* One or two emails, same message to all\n* Maybe one “sounds interesting” as a response\n* No follow-ups\n\nThen they move on and say cold doesn’t work. That’s not outreach, that’s a coin toss.\n\nWe manage outbound for 20+ startups and run over 80 LinkedIn accounts. Across all that, here’s what we’ve seen actually work consistently.\n\n**Before you send anything:**  \nFor outbound to work, you need volume, structure, and constant iterations.  \nAnd it all starts with the **value proposition.**  \nIf you don’t know *who* you’re selling to and *why*, no sequence will save you.\n\nStart with one clear ICP. Not just “CTOs” or “tech startups in US”, but an actual segment you understand: their day-to-day, their tools, their pain. If your list includes 5 buyer types, no one will relate to your message.\n\n**The minimum infrastructure we’ve seen work:**\n\n* Minimum 500–1000 contacts per month for each segment (NOT total)\n* 12+ multi-channel touches: email, LinkedIn, other platforms, depending on your TA\n* Track replies: positive, neutral, bounce, objection\n* Review your lists and messaging weekly\n* Iterate on subject lines, angles, CTA types\n\n**Here’s a real funnel we ran:**  \n1000 contacts → 52 replies → 25 warm → 16 meetings → 10 qualified → 1 closed → 1 still in pipeline (longer cycle)\n\nThese are healthy benchmarks.\n\nIf you sent 50 emails and got nothing back - that’s not failure, that’s just statistics. But even when you do get a reply - it’s too early to celebrate.\n\nA positive reply does not equal a deal. It’s only the start. To move it to close, you have to nurture it: with follow-ups, with cross-channel touches, and with time. That’s what lead nurturing is - a deliberate sequence of touches until the contact becomes a customer.\n\n**Here’s how one of those deals actually closed:**\n\n* Started with the CRO on LinkedIn. He replied “sounds interesting”\n* Sent a couple follow-ups with more context\n* In one reply, he mentioned their Sales Director in New York\n* Found his email, reached out\n* Got: “interested but not ready to jump on a call”\n* Sent a detailed breakdown of how we help companies like theirs\n* Followed up 3 more times over email and LinkedIn\n* Only then we booked a call\n\n**Total: 6–7 touches across two channels over several weeks. Totally normal.**\n\nThis is where many teams lose the lead: they either rush to push a call after the first “sounds interesting” without context or warming up, or they get scared to follow up and let it go cold. The key is to know where the person is in the process and guide them forward with the right next touch.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nA lot of people say:   \n*“Outbound without trust feels like screaming into the void.”*  \n“I don’t want to be another random DM in someone’s inbox.”\n\nAnd they’re right. But trust doesn’t have to exist before the first touch. You can build it inside the sequence: through relevance, consistency, and thoughtful follow-up.\n\nOutreach fails not because it’s cold, but because:\n\n* targeting is vague\n* messaging is generic\n* volume is too low to learn\n* and no one follows up\n\nCold outreach isn’t dead. But lazy outreach should be.","author":"decaster3","score":24,"numComments":31,"subreddit":"startups","permalink":"/r/startups/comments/1neyixl/cold_outreach_wont_work_for_your_startup_heres/","createdUtc":1757669020,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1neyixl/cold_outreach_wont_work_for_your_startup_heres/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895608552,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

Not just the basics (source, medium, campaign, content, term) but also placement, keyword, creative ID, match type, device\n* Track using a data-driven attribution model. Do not rely only on last click\n* Share back conversions to ad platforms with server-side integrations. Meta CAPI or CRM CAPI, Google Enhanced Conversions or Enhanced Conversions for Leads, LinkedIn Offline Conversions. Setup depends on your activities\n* Send the right event names. Lead, Signup, DemoRequested, Qualified, Paid. Include value if you have it\n* Build audiences that learn over time. Activated users, paid users, high LTV users, churned users. Exclude paid from prospecting\n\nWhat to watch\n\n* Visitor to signup rate by channel and by page\n* Cost per signup and cost per qualified signup\n* Lead quality signals. Demo show rate, reply rate, time to first value\n\nStage 2. Acquisition funnel  \nGoal is clear value before forms and friction that matches price point.\n\n* Track where users drop. Page, field, step\n* Cut fields that are not must-have. Use progressive profiling later\n* Show social proof and a simple promise above the fold\n* Split traffic by intent. High intent to direct signup or demo. Low intent to content or email capture\n* Measure form answers and connect them to each lead to see how different answers impact the quality of a lead\n\nWhat to watch\n\n* Visitor to signup percentage, by channel and by landing page\n* Signup completion time\n* Top three exit points\n\nStage 3. Onboarding  \nThis is where most funnels leak.\n\n* Define the key onboarding steps that move users closer to activation\n* Instrument crisp product events. Keep names simple. SignedUp, CompletedOnboarding, ReachedActivation, UsedCoreFeature\n* Run lifecycle nudges tied to those events. Email, in-app, chat. One nudge, one action\n* Shorten time to first value. Templates, defaults, guided setup, a short checklist\n\nWhat to watch\n\n* Signup to onboarding completion percentage\n* Time to onboarding completion\n* Drop-offs by step or by channel\n\nStage 4. Activation  \nThe moment users actually get value.\n\n* Define activation for your product (created project, integrated a data source, invited a teammate, shipped first workflow)\n* Make it easy to reach activation quickly with templates, defaults, and guides\n* Track how long it takes and which users never get there\n* Segment by channel and persona to see where activation struggles most\n\nWhat to watch\n\n* Onboarding to activation percentage\n* Time to activation\n* Activation by channel and by segment\n\nStage 5. Retention  \nHabits keep revenue. Silence predicts churn.\n\n* Define healthy usage. Weekly active, feature adoption, team seats, workflows run\n* Build a risk score from usage drops. Trigger human outreach when needed\n* Run lifecycle programs. Onboarding, adoption, reactivation, expansion\n* Give save options. Pause, downgrade, billing grace\n\nWhat to watch\n\n* Logo churn and revenue churn\n* Cohort retention curves\n* Adoption of sticky features\n\nStage 6. Billing and recovery  \nThis is the quiet profit killer. Treat it like a product.\n\n* Use smart retries around bank refresh and typical pay cycles\n* Turn on account updater services for card refreshes where available\n* Send short, friendly recovery messages that feel like support, not collections\n* Offer backup payment methods. ACH, PayPal, another card\n* Add a secondary gateway if your volume justifies it\n* Set up a custom tool for failed payments to boost recovery rates\n\nWhat to watch\n\n* Share of churn that is failed payments\n* Recovery rate within 7 to 14 days\n* Net revenue saved from recovery\n\nCustom BI dashboard  \nYou need one source of truth. Power BI, Looker, Tableau, or Mode all work.\n\n* Track every step of the funnel with breakdowns by channel, campaign, keyword, placement, creative\n* Build lead-by-lead breakdown tied to all UTM parameters. This shows exactly where your best leads come from\n* Connect form answers to leads and track how they impact downstream quality and conversion\n* Include billing, retention, and failed payments so hidden leaks become visible\n* Funnel views should highlight bottlenecks between stages. If activation drops after onboarding or retention dips after three months, you immediately know where to focus\n* Use the dashboard to optimize campaigns and allocate budget where it really drives results\n\nHow to map everything in practice  \nKeep it stupid simple. One page, one source of truth.\n\n* Draw the steps. Demand generation, Acquisition, Onboarding, Activation, Retention, Billing and recovery\n* For each step track three numbers. Volume, conversion rate to next step, time between steps\n* Break it down by channel, by plan, by company size, by industry. Start with one cut that matters most for your ICP\n* Review weekly. Pick one bottleneck and ship one fix. Do not try to fix five things at once\n\nThe simple habits are what make this stick. I like to run a weekly growth standup where we look at the mapped flow and percentages, then pick one bottleneck and one fix. Every month I go deeper into things like cohorts, payback, and LTV versus CAC by channel. And once a quarter I clean house by cutting events we don’t use, fields nobody needs, and reports no one reads.\n\nWhy does this matter? Paid ads will help you grow, but without the bigger picture you’re just pouring budget into a leaky bucket. When you actually map the flow and share the data back, your ads get smarter, onboarding gets tighter, lifecycle stays timely, and billing stops leaking. It’s the compounding effect that makes growth real.\n\nThis is just a high level overview. I can go super detailed on any of these steps if it’s useful.\n\nI’m curious, how are you tracking your data and do you actually use it to improve performance and revenue?","author":"N3k1i","score":2,"numComments":5,"subreddit":"startups","permalink":"/r/startups/comments/1neaw3s/how_well_do_you_know_your_data_a_full_playbook_to/","createdUtc":1757602258,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1neaw3s/how_well_do_you_know_your_data_a_full_playbook_to/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895608552,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

It runs locally, adapts to edge-class hardware, and validates itself under stress.\n\nIt can scale itself according to the constraints of the device it's on, from a micro controller all the way to industrial size systems.\n\nIt's not a wrapper.It's not a cloud based AI, it's totally self-contained, in the footprint is so small.You could run it on a smartwatch. It uses totally unique tech that I came up with myself, nobody else is using these methods.  \n\nI built this thing from nothing on a ten year old laptop.  And I didn't think it was going to work but I just got it to fire up yesterday, and i don't know what to do.  \n\nOnce I figure out how to post post the link here, I  will but I want to make sure everything's privated so nobody can see the source code.  \n\nI will post a couple screenshots so you can see.But, but, to be honest, I didn't think it was gonna work and I went to sleep as it was building...   Can someone gives some advice on my next move please? This whole thing.Just kind of exploded out of nowhere.I didn't expect to build this thing.It just kind of happened.\n\nI really need advice.  I'll work on getting the specs and capabilities posted but I really have a lot going on so please be patient. \n\n\nEDIT - here are the specs, please bear with me.I live in my car. \n\n\nMicroGen AI Runtime — Technical Overview\n\nMicroGen is a modular runtime designed to operate autonomously across a wide range of hardware. It’s not a model. It’s not a wrapper. It’s a system. Built to adapt, validate, and survive.\n\nMemory Footprint\n\nBase Runtime: ~18MB idle footprint\n\nTelemetry + Validation Engine active: ~32MB\n\nFull Cascade Execution (6 active nodes): ~48–64MB depending on trace depth\n\nKnowledge Graph Explorer loaded: ~72MB peak\n\nEdge-class minimum viable config: 512MB RAM (confirmed stable)\n\nMicroGen was tested on a 512MB RAM, 4-core, 2.4GHz edge-class device. It ran clean. No swap. No crash. That’s not theoretical—that’s deployed.\n\nRuntime Scaling\n\nNode architecture is modular. You can run 1 node or 100. Each node is isolated, traceable, and hot-swappable.\n\nCascade depth is configurable. Default is 5 layers deep. You can push it further if your hardware allows.\n\nTelemetry verbosity scales with available memory. On low-memory devices, it auto-throttles logging and trace detail.\n\nValidation engine supports partial or full mode. Partial mode uses less memory and skips deep reprocessing unless triggered.\n\nHardware Compatibility\n\nMinimum viable:\n\n512MB RAM\n\n2+ CPU cores\n\nNo GPU required\n\nOptimal config:\n\n2GB+ RAM\n\n4+ cores\n\nSSD or fast I/O for trace logging\n\nTested on:\n\nReplit virtual container\n\nLocal Linux VM\n\nRaspberry Pi 4 (with swap disabled)\n\nAndroid 15 mobile browser (via Replit)\n\nMicroGen doesn’t rely on cloud APIs. It runs where you put it. That includes edge devices, offline systems, and constrained environments.\n\nCore Components\n\nMetacognitive Validation Engine (MVE):Scores every output. If confidence drops below threshold, it reprocesses or cascades deeper. You can tune the threshold from 0.1 to 0.9.\n\nCascade Engine:Intent flows activate nodes. If the system isn’t confident, it deepens the trace. You can set max depth and continuation thresholds.\n\nDevice Profiler:Reads system specs and adjusts runtime behavior. If RAM is low, it disables non-critical modules. If CPU is slow, it staggers node activation.\n\nTelemetry & Analytics:Tracks latency, confidence, node activation, and system health. Exportable as JSON or CSV. P95 latency is near-zero on edge-class hardware.\n\nKnowledge Graph Explorer:Visualizes semantic relationships. You can query domains, trace facts, and see how the system connects ideas.\n\nIntent Classifier:Parses input, scores fragments, and routes to relevant nodes. Integrates with validation and telemetry.\n\nConfiguration Options\n\nConfidence thresholds\n\nCascade depth\n\nValidation strictness\n\nTelemetry verbosity\n\nNode activation strategy\n\nDomain-specific KG filters\n\nWhat Makes It Different\n\nThis is a self contained self correcting adaptable solution.","author":"mrsir0517","score":0,"numComments":8,"subreddit":"startups","permalink":"/r/startups/comments/1ne8suz/im_a_solo_developer_that_built_a_self_contained/","createdUtc":1757597223,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ne8suz/im_a_solo_developer_that_built_a_self_contained/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895608552,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1ndwd30","title":"Geo-Location Travel Brand (I will not promote)","body":"Would you buy from a brand that uses geolocation-restricted purchasing as a core feature?\n\nI’m launching a travel-inspired lifestyle brand that bridges handmade artisan craftsmanship with modern luxury positioning.\n\nThe idea is to bring back location-based nostalgia that boutiques offered, for a digital era. It’s less-so scavenger hunts, and moreso unlocking access to different items based on where you are in the world.\n\nAlready validated demand with 100 pre-orders from industry contacts (and fulfilled them with warm reception), but I’m curious about broader market reception of two specific elements:\n\nThe geolocation concept: Only people physically located in specific regions can purchase certain exclusive items - we’re starting by offering our signature color exclusively in these regions around the world. Think handmade, natural leather slippers in different colors, and our signature brand color is reserved for the locations that inspired our collection. You’d either need to be there, travel there, or have someone there buy for you. The idea is recreating that boutique discovery feeling while building community around each “location unlock.”\n\nThe homepage has an interactive map highlighting regions where we offer exclusive items, and you can geolocate yourself to see if you’re in range. If you’re not in range, you can still shop our General Release items.\n\nThe idea is that in 5-10 years perhaps more of us will be shopping with AR/VR. As the internet and ecommerce flatten culture and the shopping experience in many ways, how can we keep the nostalgia and excitement of discovery that in-person shopping provides? This is a midway point that gets people thinking about their relationship with shopping and location/travel. When/if we do reach the point where we’re VR shopping, we’ll all be in different virtual boutiques - I think it’ll be a huge advantage to offer different items in your different VR Boutique locations, just like you might offer location-specific in-store exclusives IRL. We have branding about how this all ties together and how the regions are chosen based on inspiring our first collection.\n\nPrice point: Premier handmade pieces around $450 (think leather goods crafted at natural tanneries, apparel made with traditional trims). Everything’s made by master artisans using centuries-old techniques.\n\nHave you seen location-restricted purchasing work? Does it feel gimmicky or genuinely compelling? And at what price point does “handmade by artisans” justify premium positioning for you?\n\nNot looking for design feedback - more interested in thoughts on the purchasing experience and value perception.","author":"punsil","score":1,"numComments":1,"subreddit":"startups","permalink":"/r/startups/comments/1ndwd30/geolocation_travel_brand_i_will_not_promote/","createdUtc":1757554940,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ndwd30/geolocation_travel_brand_i_will_not_promote/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895608552,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1ndfkbg","title":"Marketing agencies don’t tell you this: growth lives in your bottlenecks - I will not promote","body":"I’ve been in growth and marketing for 15 years, mostly with B2B and SaaS companies. One thing I’ve learned: running more ads won’t fix a broken funnel.\n\nAgencies will happily take your budget and show you click numbers, but real growth doesn’t come from ads alone. It comes from looking at the entire journey and finding the bottlenecks that hold you back.\n\nWhen I start with a new company, the first thing I do is map the full flow:\n\nDemand generation\nAcquisition funnel\nOnboarding\nActivation\nRetention\nBilling and recovery\nThen I look at the percentages between each step. For example:\n\nHow many website visitors turn into signups\nHow many signups actually activate and get to value\nHow many active users stick around after the first month\nHow many paying customers fail to renew because of churn or failed payments\n\nOnce you put real numbers against these steps, the bottlenecks jump out. If you’re converting only 2% of signups into active users, fixing onboarding will create more growth than doubling your ad spend. If 5–10% of your MRR disappears into failed payments every month, fixing billing will return more revenue than a new campaign.\n\nThis is why lifecycle and CRM matter so much. Marketing is just one piece of the system. Growth happens when you connect the dots across the full journey and keep improving the weakest link.\n\nThe best teams I’ve worked with are the ones who do exactly this. They connect marketing, product, and data instead of keeping them in silos. They understand that ads and acquisition are only the start, and the real leverage comes from optimizing the whole journey.\n\nHow do you look at your customer journey?

{"id":"1ndbg6y","title":"The “you need a co-founder” advice is dead. I will not promote","body":"For 20 years everyone repeated the same mantra: *“Don’t start alone. You need a co-founder.”*  \nPaul Graham said it. YC enforced it. Investors treated solo founders like red flags.\n\nThat made sense back then.\n\nIn 2005, building a startup looked like this:\n\n* One person hacked code on bare metal servers\n* One person begged investors for money\n* One person hustled for distribution and sales\n\nIf you didn’t have two or three skill sets covered you were toast.\n\nFast forward to 2025 and that entire argument collapsed.\n\n**AI eats half of what co-founders used to do**  \nChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Copilot. You basically have a technical partner, a copywriter, a designer, and a marketing strategist on demand.\n\n**No-code eats the other half**  \nBubble, Webflow, Softr, Bolt.new. One person can ship a SaaS MVP in a weekend that used to take a team of engineers and months of work.\n\n**Global on-demand talent fills the gaps**  \nWhy give up 50 percent of your company when you can hire a fractional CMO, contract a designer for $500, or get a VA overseas. Every co-founder you bring in at the start is basically giving away a chunk of your future exit just to cover skills that you can now rent by the hour.\n\n**Distribution is democratized**  \nYou don’t need a “sales co-founder” when Reddit, X, TikTok, Product Hunt, and cold email automation can get you in front of thousands of users in a week.\n\n**Proof is everywhere**\n\n* Jeff Bezos → Amazon\n* Tope Awotona → Calendly ($3B valuation)\n* Sara Blakely → Spanx (billionaire solo founder)\n* Markus Frind → Plenty of Fish (sold for $575M)\n* Pieter Levels → Nomad List and RemoteOK (millions ARR solo)\n\nEven YC (the same YC that once said *“we rarely fund solo founders”*) has solo founders in every batch now. Carta data shows that around 40 percent of new startups are solo-founded. Indie SaaS surveys say more than 50 percent of profitable bootstrapped businesses started with one person.\n\nSo why does this zombie idea still float around\n\n* Investors cling to the “team” narrative because it feels safer for them\n* Founders like the comfort of sharing the emotional rollercoaster\n* People confuse want with need\n\nHere is the raw truth. You don’t need a co-founder anymore. You might want one for moral support or to split the 3 a.m. panic attacks but the days of being “unfundable” or “impossible to build” as a solo founder are gone.\n\nOne determined person with today’s stack has more leverage than three founders did a decade ago. Keeping all the equity means you are not slicing away your upside before you even know if the idea works. If you give away 30 to 50 percent of your company at day zero just because of old startup dogma you are burning millions of dollars in future value.","author":"Such_Faithlessness11","score":0,"numComments":16,"subreddit":"startups","permalink":"/r/startups/comments/1ndbg6y/the_you_need_a_cofounder_advice_is_dead_i_will/","createdUtc":1757503256,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ndbg6y/the_you_need_a_cofounder_advice_is_dead_i_will/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895608552,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

Pymetrics uses AI to evaluate candidates, helping companies reduce bias.\n\nMercor claims its **ARR** has hit **$100 million**, with data labeling being the core growth driver. After Meta acquired Scale AI, many clients (like OpenAI and Google) started to feel Scale AI wasn't \"neutral\" enough. Mercor capitalized on this by focusing on providing highly skilled experts—like PhDs and lawyers—for data labeling. This unique advantage helped them land top-tier AI labs like OpenAI and Applied Compute as key customers.\n\nHere's the kicker: Mercor's founder, Foody, insists this isn't a pivot. He still sees Mercor as a recruiting company, arguing that data labeling is just another way of matching workers with companies.\n\n**So, what are your thoughts on this? Is it a brilliant strategic move or just some fancy re-branding?**","author":"Big-Hat9483","score":0,"numComments":2,"subreddit":"startups","permalink":"/r/startups/comments/1ncxbdp/after_scale_ai_another_startup_is_helping_ai_labs/","createdUtc":1757457284,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ncxbdp/after_scale_ai_another_startup_is_helping_ai_labs/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895608552,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

Engagement churn: customers who stay subscribed but stop using the product\n\n● Track signals like logins, feature use, support tickets\n\n● Nudge inactive users with lifecycle emails or in-app prompts\n\n● In higher-touch products, a simple CSM check-in call goes a long way\n\n● This is often the earliest warning sign before real cancellations\n\n\nThe best SaaS teams I’ve worked with build playbooks for all three.

I’m building an iOS app.\n I really don’t want to be locked into Mapbox or Google’s APIs because their free tiers are tiny, the costs spike way too fast, and honestly we’d outgrow them before even seeing revenue. So I’ve been experimenting with self-hosted routing engines like OSRM, Valhalla, and GraphHopper.\n Here’s the reality though:\n  \nOSRM → super fast, but preprocessing North America or planet-wide data keeps OOM-killing my 48 GB RAM + 256 GB swap VPS. I’ve filtered down to drivable roads only, made progress, but it still dies halfway through.\n Valhalla → love the feature set, but tile builds are huge, and I’m not sure if it’s the smartest choice for worldwide coverage without serious hardware.\n GraphHopper → Java-based, and also pretty RAM-hungry for imports. Seems solid, but maybe better suited for regional extracts.\n  \nI’m at a crossroads (pun intended 😅). I need:\n  \nWorldwide or at least North America coverage\n Car routing only (don’t care about bikes/walkers)\n Polyline + step-by-step directions I can overlay on Mapbox maps and feed into CarPlay\n Something that won’t bankrupt me before launch\n  \nI’ve also looked at hosted APIs (Google, HERE, TomTom, etc.) but they get expensive real quick. Ideally, I’d love to find a partner service that works with early-stage startups or an open-source stack that’s lighter on preprocessing.\n So I guess my questions are:\n  \nHas anyone here solved this at startup scale without burning crazy $$$?\n Are there routing providers who actually partner with small apps to give better terms?\n Or am I better off sharding (e.g., NA/EU/Asia) and reverse-proxying multiple self-hosted OSRM/Valhalla builds?\n  \nAny advice, war stories, or “here’s what worked for us” would be amazing.

{"id":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1neyixl/cold_outreach_wont_work_for_your_startup_heres/","title":"Cold outreach won’t work for your startup. Here’s why [I will not promote]","body":"I talk to a lot of startup founders: clients, friends, people I meet at events, and many of them say the same thing: \"We tried cold outreach. It didn’t really work for us.\"\n So I ask: what did you actually try?\n And 9 times out of 10, when you start digging into details, it’s something like this:\n  \nA list of 100 people from different industries\n One or two emails, same message to all\n Maybe one “sounds interesting” as a response\n No follow-ups\n  \nThen they move on and say cold doesn’t work. That’s not outreach, that’s a coin toss.\n We manage outbound for 20+ startups and run over 80 LinkedIn accounts. Across all that, here’s what we’ve seen actually work consistently.\n Before you send anything:\n For outbound to work, you need volume, structure, and constant iterations.\n And it all starts with the value proposition.\n If you don’t know who you’re selling to and why, no sequence will save you.\n Start with one clear ICP. Not just “CTOs” or “tech startups in US”, but an actual segment you understand: their day-to-day, their tools, their pain. If your list includes 5 buyer types, no one will relate to your message.\n The minimum infrastructure we’ve seen work:\n  \nMinimum 500–1000 contacts per month for each segment (NOT total)\n 12+ multi-channel touches: email, LinkedIn, other platforms, depending on your TA\n Track replies: positive, neutral, bounce, objection\n Review your lists and messaging weekly\n Iterate on subject lines, angles, CTA types\n  \nHere’s a real funnel we ran:\n 1000 contacts → 52 replies → 25 warm → 16 meetings → 10 qualified → 1 closed → 1 still in pipeline (longer cycle)\n These are healthy benchmarks.\n If you sent 50 emails and got nothing back - that’s not failure, that’s just statistics. But even when you do get a reply - it’s too early to celebrate.\n A positive reply does not equal a deal. It’s only the start. To move it to close, you have to nurture it: with follow-ups, with cross-channel touches, and with time. That’s what lead nurturing is - a deliberate sequence of touches until the contact becomes a customer.\n Here’s how one of those deals actually closed:\n  \nStarted with the CRO on LinkedIn. He replied “sounds interesting”\n Sent a couple follow-ups with more context\n In one reply, he mentioned their Sales Director in New York\n Found his email, reached out\n Got: “interested but not ready to jump on a call”\n Sent a detailed breakdown of how we help companies like theirs\n Followed up 3 more times over email and LinkedIn\n Only then we booked a call\n  \nTotal: 6–7 touches across two channels over several weeks. Totally normal.\n This is where many teams lose the lead: they either rush to push a call after the first “sounds interesting” without context or warming up, or they get scared to follow up and let it go cold. The key is to know where the person is in the process and guide them forward with the right next touch.\n TL;DR:\n A lot of people say: \n “Outbound without trust feels like screaming into the void.”\n “I don’t want to be another random DM in someone’s inbox.”\n And they’re right. But trust doesn’t have to exist before the first touch. You can build it inside the sequence: through relevance, consistency, and thoughtful follow-up.\n Outreach fails not because it’s cold, but because:\n  \ntargeting is vague\n messaging is generic\n volume is too low to learn\n and no one follows up\n  \nCold outreach isn’t dead. But lazy outreach should be.\n    submitted by    /u/decaster3  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"startups","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1neyixl/cold_outreach_wont_work_for_your_startup_heres/","createdUtc":1757895601.693,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1neyixl/cold_outreach_wont_work_for_your_startup_heres/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601693,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":20,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":5,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":20}}}

{"id":"1nh0nfj","title":"How I validated my MVP and earned $60k within a year of its launch","body":"$60,000 might not be a big deal, but earning through a product you created gives you and the product a sense of validation. I hope this helps anyone looking to validate their MVP.\n\nMy co-founder and I started building our Saas in 2021.\n\n**The thought:**  \nWe created a product that solved the issue that we had been continuously facing. We did our research, and there was no practical solution available back then in the market. No, AI couldn't code back then. It was just two of us (hardcore techies) with no knowledge of sales.\n\n**First Version:**  \nBy May 2022, our simple MVP was ready to launch.\n\n**Product Hunt Launch:**  \nWe launched our first version ever on Product Hunt with no expectation whatsoever. We received 24 comments in total, ranked 6 for the day. We weren't expecting any sales; we just wanted to know if the product we were making was in demand or not. We didn't get any sales, but we did get around 50 users who created an account on our platform. We tracked each one of them and grinned happily when they spent time exploring our product.\n\nThe comments we received were all positive, assuring us that we were on the right path, and that was enough for us to keep moving on it.\n\n**Feedback Filtered & Implemented:**  \nWe continuously filtered and refined our product based on our users' feedback. Remember, do not take all the feature suggestions; only go with the ones that make sense to you.\n\n**Product Hunt Launch:**  \nOn 20th January 2023, we relaunched a better version of our product. Received better response and even made it to ProductHunt official Twitter post, where they promote the products they like. No, money is not involved.  \nSome users with massive followers on X mentioned our product as \"SAAS which broke the internet this week.\" We were ecstatic. We gained a lot of users and around 128 new paid monthly subscribers.\n\n**Appsumo Launch**  \nFinally, we listed our product on a platform known to sell LTD or Lifetime Deals. We were approached by them for their Select program. Appsumo's launch gave us the exposure we needed.  \nMade **$60K+** sales in the span of two months. Plus, the exposure we received was massive.  \nToday, our product (BlogHunch) has a good user base. We are serving **6K+ Businesses, proving our product is now market validated.**\n\nSummary  \nTo validate BlogHunch, we followed a lean approach:\n\n1. **Confirmed the Problem**: We identified a gap in the market through our own struggles and verified it with research.\n2. **Launched a Simple MVP**: Our Product Hunt launch in May 2022 attracted 50 sign-ups and 24 positive comments, confirming initial demand.\n3. **Listened and Iterated**: We filtered user feedback to refine the product, focusing only on features aligned with our vision.\n4. **Relaunched with Confidence**: The January 2023 Product Hunt launch brought 128 paid subscribers, proving a stronger market fit.\n5. **Scaled with AppSumo**: The $60K+ in sales from the AppSumo launch validated our product for solopreneurs and bloggers.\n\n*All of that, but here is the truth: In 2023, we were in a phase where we were trying to find the right target audience for our product.*\n\nReason? We were clear about our audience before the launch, but we made a mistake.  \nWe listened to every feature suggestion and launched it. We sought \"too\" much validation from outside.\n\nThat was a *HUGE* mistake.\n\nIt pushed our growth (since we were trapped in our development cycle) and blurred our product's vision. I think this is something a lot of entrepreneurs deal with.\n\nToday, **BlogHunch** has found its place among \"Small & Medium Enterprises,\" and we are sticking to it.\n\nRemember, Market Validation is important, but Your Vision & \"Why\" you started it are equally important.\n\nDon't be too busy perfecting your product while your competitors take away your customers.","author":{"name":"soni_ritu"},"score":6,"numComments":8,"subreddit":{"display_name":"Entrepreneur"},"permalink":"/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nh0nfj/how_i_validated_my_mvp_and_earned_60k_within_a/","createdUtc":1757878667,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nh0nfj/how_i_validated_my_mvp_and_earned_60k_within_a/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895605375,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

But here’s the thing: I’ve already launched multiple projects, developed my own software as a service (SaaS), experimented with dropshipping and affiliate marketing, and learnt more about business in the past year than most adults do in a decade.\n\nIt hasn’t been easy. My first project was a simple prompt tool called Promptforge. I posted it online and... nothing happened. No users. No feedback. Just silence.\n\nRather than giving up, I learnt from the experience. How do people actually find products? How do you create something they really want? This led me to create tAIsk, a goal-setting assistant. Then I tried dropshipping and affiliate marketing. Total failure. However, each time I failed, I learnt valuable lessons about how business works.\n\nToday, I’m developing Yobio: a simple yet powerful bio page software as a service (SaaS) that helps creators present themselves better. It's a small project, but this time I'm doing things differently: I’m talking to users, making improvements every day and maintaining consistency.\n\nThe most important lesson I’ve learned is that business isn't about tricks or hacks. It's about solving real problems and being patient enough to see results.\n\nIf you’re young and thinking that you should wait until you’re older to start, don't. The best way to learn about business is to actually do business.

{"id":"1ngwf11","title":"Solve your own problem first, it’s probably someone else’s problem too","body":"I’ve always been interested in entrepreneurship and believed that solving other people’s problems would make me rich (and it’s true). But what if you don’t really understand the space you’re trying to solve for?\n\nWhen I was close to giving up, I realized something: having only one source of income (in my case, my job) meant I was just one step away from financial collapse.\n\nSo I decided to start a Shopify store. That’s when I began running into problems and I had two options or find an existing solution or build one myself. Sure, there are tools out there, but they didn’t really do what I needed. For example, as someone new to Shopify, everyone kept telling me to use SEMRush or Ahrefs to analyze performance, SEO, etc. But those tools are too macro great for experienced people, but overwhelming if you’re just getting started.\n\nWhat I really needed was something micro. That’s what I built. And when I shared it, I realized I wasn’t alone. Not everyone wants the big, complicated solution many people just want something simple and focused.\n\nThat’s when I truly understood the value of solving my own pain point: because I had lived it, I could actually feel what others were going through.\n\nMy takeaway - you don’t always need to experience every single problem firsthand to build a solution. But when you do, you understand the pain deeply and that clarity makes it easier to build something meaningful. And once you find others who depend on what you created, you get an extra push of motivation.","author":{"name":"Slow-Device-1894"},"score":3,"numComments":4,"subreddit":{"display_name":"Entrepreneur"},"permalink":"/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ngwf11/solve_your_own_problem_first_its_probably_someone/","createdUtc":1757868868,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ngwf11/solve_your_own_problem_first_its_probably_someone/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895605375,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

They are also validated by a moderation team ( that doesnt exist yet); so the platform only shows real \"good quality problems\". Also, to post a problem, you need to meet some requirements, like minimum word count so the problems are really well detailed.\n\nThe reasoning behind it: many startups fail because they solve “nice-to-have” issues instead of real pain points. I wanted to create a place where validated, real-world problems are the starting point.\n\nSo this is like a marketplace, but isntead of products, its ideas/problems, people face on their lifes.\n\nSo the buyers gain value because they can get many validated real life proven ideas to serve as inspiration to open a business or a startup, or build a tech tool, i dont know, anything really.\n\nAnd the seller ,well, who doesnt want to make money with their own hardships?\n\nRight now, the MVP lets you:\n\nSign up an account\n\nSubmit problems (with category, difficulty, and description)\n\nBrowse problems in a feed with filters\n\nUpvote and explore different categories","author":{"name":"porscheferreira"},"score":4,"numComments":10,"subreddit":{"display_name":"Entrepreneur"},"permalink":"/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ngmgtp/i_built_an_mvp_where_people_share_their_real/","createdUtc":1757840776,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ngmgtp/i_built_an_mvp_where_people_share_their_real/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895605375,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1nghxrt","title":"How I started earning passive income on YouTube without hitting 1,000 subs (with proof)","body":"Most people think you need a big YouTube channel, thousands of subs and AdSense to make money. Honestly, that mindset kept me from even trying for a long time. I thought: “What’s the point if I’m not monetized yet\"?\n\nBut here’s what changed things for me: instead of waiting on YouTube to approve me for ads, I started creating videos around products I had already made. Simple stuff, digital templates and guides I put together using free tools. Every video was basically a “how-to” or a problem solver, and at the end I’d naturally mention: “By the way, I made a template for this if you want to grab it”.\n\nNo clickbait, no trying to go viral. Just helpful videos that live forever. What’s wild is those small, evergreen videos keep working in the background. One video might only get a few hundred views, but if 2 or 3 people buy from it every month, that video becomes a little passive income machine. Stack enough of them, and it snowballs.\n\nThe best part? You don’t need fancy editing or a huge personality. Screen shares, voiceover, even just raw explanations work if you’re solving a real problem. That’s what makes this so scalable, every video is like a tiny digital asset that keeps paying you long after you hit publish.\n\nIf you’re curious how to set this up step by step, I break down the exact system I used in my bio.\n\nThe proof is inside the resource itself if you don't believe me, which is in my bio if you don't believe me. \n\nI love this business model so much and I am sharing it here because it actually spreads genuine value and knowledge. It's not the scammy or scummy like the fake AI models or only fans side hustles or passive income methods lol.

{"id":"1ng43lz","title":"8 Unofficial Rules of Adulthood Nobody Tells You","body":"Remember being a kid and thinking grown-ups had it all figured out? Then you get older and realize nobody does. We're all just trying our best. These are the rules I finally figured out that made my life a lot easier.\n\n1. **The only person you're competing with is who you were yesterday.** Stop comparing your behind-the-scenes reality to everyone else's highlight reel. Your journey is unique. The only progress that matters is your own.\n2. **You'll outgrow some friends, and that's okay.** Sometimes, people are meant to be in your life for a short time, not forever. As you grow, you'll change, and so will your friends. It's not a bad thing; it's just a part of life.\n3. **Your brain is not designed for happiness.** It's designed to keep you safe. That's why it's always looking for problems and telling you to worry. You have to tell it to stop and choose to focus on the good stuff instead.\n4. **Confidence is built by doing, not thinking.** You don't just wake up one day and feel confident. You build it by taking small, uncomfortable steps. Want to be a good speaker? Start by talking to one person.\n5. **A \"bad day\" isn't a bad life.** We all have days that suck. But a bad moment, a hard conversation, or a setback doesn't mean your whole life is bad. Learn to let those moments go.\n6. **Money buys you freedom, not things.** Don't just chase a bigger paycheck to buy more stuff. Chase it so you can have the freedom to say \"no\" to a job you hate and \"yes\" to things you love.\n7. **The perfect time doesn't exist.** There will never be a \"perfect time\" to start that new project or make that big change. The people who are winning started before they were ready. The best time to start is right now.\n8. **Real happiness comes from living on purpose.** You can follow all these rules, but if you're not living a life that means something to you, you'll still feel empty. The real secret to a good life is figuring out your purpose and building your life around it.\n\nI know what it feels like to feel lost and like you're just going through the motions. That’s exactly why I created Purposa (app on the app store). It's a simple system to help men who are tired of feeling stuck and want to start living with more meaning.","author":{"name":"yurahyli"},"score":4,"numComments":4,"subreddit":{"display_name":"Entrepreneur"},"permalink":"/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ng43lz/8_unofficial_rules_of_adulthood_nobody_tells_you/","createdUtc":1757786135,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ng43lz/8_unofficial_rules_of_adulthood_nobody_tells_you/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895605375,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1nfft2b","title":"every single place I try to market my app blocks me","body":"I've created an app and every single place I tried to promote blocks me. The playbooks I've copied from this sub and also from other gurus online have all failed so far.\n\nI won't be sharing the app name because I don't want it to be banned, but the problem I've always had in my life was that sending follow-ups emails was boring (I've been on sales for good 10 years) and I wanted to automate it. It's a product focused on sales people (Account Executives, etc). This is an important detail.\n\nNow, most people recommendations are the following:\n\n* join some niche communities on discord, reddit, etc\n* launch on product hunt\n* create a blog and do some SEO\n* create a newsletter and recruit some early customers\n\ndon't:\n\n* do google ads right away\n* avoid spamming people with cold emails\n* contact micro influencers as they are a waste of time\n\nNow, I've tried to casually reply some comments on subs like /sales and I got banned permanently from there. Honestly my replies were thoughtful and I wrote things from my experience, without mentioning my tool or whatever, and just a simple link leads to a ban. Other places like OpenAI community, or even Twitter, have gotten zero traction on the posts I've started there.\n\nI'm right now creating a blog for my product to start ranking on SEO, and also trying to use some cold email products to send emails to my target audience.\n\nBut I keep thinking: maybe my product is doomed because sales people don't like to buy products?

Recently I worked with someone who wanted to start a carpet cleaning company but had no idea how much revenue they could realistically make, how much to spend upfront, or how to present their concept to investors.\n\nWe built a full business plan that included startup costs, monthly breakdowns, and three-year projections. Alongside that we created a pitch deck they could show to lenders and investors. We even modeled two financing scenarios, one where they leased their equipment and van, and one where they purchased everything upfront.\n\nWhat we discovered surprised them. If they leased equipment, their break-even point could be under a month. Even if they purchased everything outright, the break-even was still only about five months. Their first-year revenue potential came out to around $150,000 to $180,000, with net profit projected between $56,000 and $70,000.\n\nThat kind of clarity completely shifted their confidence. They went from “I think this could work” to “I know the numbers and I can prove it.”\n\nI’ve been realizing that a lot of entrepreneurs skip this step, but it’s often the difference between being taken seriously and looking like you’re just winging it.\n\nI’m curious.

It was a disaster. I lost over $5000 testing ads. I wasn’t going to give up so I  decided to think outside the box. And the idea came to me.\n\nMethod I found:\n1. Use a cloud hosting service\n2.

I also found that I am allergic to Propolis (bee byproduct) and Balsam of Peru. Propolis is less common in deodorant but Balsam of Peru can sometimes be in deodorants.\n\nI realized how big of an issue this was because every single deodorant I found in Target, CVS, and Walgreens all have fragrance as an ingredient.

I have a normal corporate job and a rental property (with a 2nd currently under contract). My niche is maintaining high-end cars for rich clients; however, I had a small semi truck dealership reach out to me wanting to outsource their new vehicle prep.\n\nAfter some initial questions on the phone from the service manager, they want me to clean (brand new) trucks before they are delivered to customers. Taking off plastic transportation protection, stickers, glue, interior wipe down, and exterior wash.

They gave me a price of $250 a truck, which is something I can work with. This would be an ideal setup because it would provide work year-round, since they have a detail bay I can use. Currently, I can't detail residential clients during the winter. Them being open until 11 pm is perfect as well because I can detail after my corporate job ends around 4 pm on weekdays. \n\nThey asked to set up an in-person meeting so we have a date and time on the schedule for next week.

First, which EU countries actually offer the best franchise ROI? I keep hearing conflicting advice about whether to go for established markets like Germany and France or emerging ones in Eastern Europe. Are there specific markets you’d completely avoid and why?\nI’m also wondering how much successful EU franchises typically need to adapt their concept for local markets. Cultural differences across Europe seem huge, and I’d love to hear about any brands that either nailed the localization or completely bombed because they tried to copy-paste their model everywhere.\nWhat’s a realistic timeframe to see decent returns in the European franchise market? I’ve seen everything from “profitable in 6 months” to “break even in 3-5 years” depending on who’s talking.

{"id":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nh0nfj/how_i_validated_my_mvp_and_earned_60k_within_a/","title":"How I validated my MVP and earned $60k within a year of its launch","body":"$60,000 might not be a big deal, but earning through a product you created gives you and the product a sense of validation. I hope this helps anyone looking to validate their MVP.\n My co-founder and I started building our Saas in 2021.\n The thought:\n We created a product that solved the issue that we had been continuously facing. We did our research, and there was no practical solution available back then in the market. No, AI couldn't code back then. It was just two of us (hardcore techies) with no knowledge of sales.\n First Version:\n By May 2022, our simple MVP was ready to launch.\n Product Hunt Launch:\n We launched our first version ever on Product Hunt with no expectation whatsoever. We received 24 comments in total, ranked 6 for the day. We weren't expecting any sales; we just wanted to know if the product we were making was in demand or not. We didn't get any sales, but we did get around 50 users who created an account on our platform. We tracked each one of them and grinned happily when they spent time exploring our product.\n The comments we received were all positive, assuring us that we were on the right path, and that was enough for us to keep moving on it.\n Feedback Filtered & Implemented:\n We continuously filtered and refined our product based on our users' feedback. Remember, do not take all the feature suggestions; only go with the ones that make sense to you.\n Product Hunt Launch:\n On 20th January 2023, we relaunched a better version of our product. Received better response and even made it to ProductHunt official Twitter post, where they promote the products they like. No, money is not involved.\n Some users with massive followers on X mentioned our product as \"SAAS which broke the internet this week.\" We were ecstatic. We gained a lot of users and around 128 new paid monthly subscribers.\n Appsumo Launch\n Finally, we listed our product on a platform known to sell LTD or Lifetime Deals. We were approached by them for their Select program. Appsumo's launch gave us the exposure we needed.\n Made $60K+ sales in the span of two months. Plus, the exposure we received was massive.\n Today, our product (BlogHunch) has a good user base. We are serving 6K+ Businesses, proving our product is now market validated.\n Summary\n To validate BlogHunch, we followed a lean approach:\n  \nConfirmed the Problem: We identified a gap in the market through our own struggles and verified it with research.\n Launched a Simple MVP: Our Product Hunt launch in May 2022 attracted 50 sign-ups and 24 positive comments, confirming initial demand.\n Listened and Iterated: We filtered user feedback to refine the product, focusing only on features aligned with our vision.\n Relaunched with Confidence: The January 2023 Product Hunt launch brought 128 paid subscribers, proving a stronger market fit.\n Scaled with AppSumo: The $60K+ in sales from the AppSumo launch validated our product for solopreneurs and bloggers.\n  \nAll of that, but here is the truth: In 2023, we were in a phase where we were trying to find the right target audience for our product.\n Reason? We were clear about our audience before the launch, but we made a mistake.\n We listened to every feature suggestion and launched it. We sought \"too\" much validation from outside.\n That was a HUGE mistake.\n It pushed our growth (since we were trapped in our development cycle) and blurred our product's vision. I think this is something a lot of entrepreneurs deal with.\n Today, BlogHunch has found its place among \"Small & Medium Enterprises,\" and we are sticking to it.\n Remember, Market Validation is important, but Your Vision & \"Why\" you started it are equally important.\n Don't be too busy perfecting your product while your competitors take away your customers.\n    submitted by    /u/soni_ritu  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"entrepreneur","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nh0nfj/how_i_validated_my_mvp_and_earned_60k_within_a/","createdUtc":1757895601.373,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1nh0nfj/how_i_validated_my_mvp_and_earned_60k_within_a/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601373,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":50,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":30,"contextScore":5,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":50}}}

{"id":"1nh0yir","title":"Help with pricing full service website offering","body":"I'm a software contractor based in the US. I’ve built, released, and even own — SaaS products, apps, and websites for over a decade. For a while now, I've been orchestrating some architecture to assist me in setting up and managing websites for small businesses in a sane way (for both parties). Essentially, handling everything from setup and release to maintenance, updates, and beyond.  I'm hoping that by offering this basic service at an economical price, I can become their go-to resource for tech-related problems, growing alongside them, rather than on their behalf.\n\nThat said, there are a lot of Wix-type offerings that help non-technical people build their own website at the cost of vendor lock-in and technical limitations — but I still find people hiring devs to create these poorly made, bloated sites (that businesses can't even take with them) on their behalf; either because they still don't have an eye for design, or simply do not have the time (they are running a business after all).\n\nEven after that, business owners have to pay someone to update and fix things when things go sideways. This can be a major headache for them because, frankly, most small business owners are rightfully clueless when it comes to what *exactly* is going wrong with their website, and by the time they coordinate an emergency fix, it can be days later and hours of labor that is not spent on running their core business. As you can imagine, this can be extremely stressful for a blue-collar contractor, restaurant, or shop owner to handle.\n\nMany “website designers”' business models involve large upfront costs for design and setup, which usually amount to taking pre-built templates (or services like Wix) and then adding the business's content, and then sending clients on their way to fend for themselves. After years of witnessing these shakedowns (of friends, family, and clients), I’ve finally identified and built a solution to remove the stress, spread the costs, and remove the large upfront investment businesses incur to get things up and running “the right way”. \n\nI'm currently piloting a new “websites made easy” subscription program geared towards business owners entering the market, or those looking to do things the right way their second/third time around. We take care of everything; the client just tells us what they want, then we build it and update it for them as required. Obviously, there are some limitations that we can account for, à la carte — i.e., increased frequency of content updates (I was leaning towards 1 update cycle per month), advanced features - such as dynamic event or specials sections, additional email addresses or domain names, or even mailing list features. Just about anything is possible because we are building you a true custom website, not limited by a large service provider's offerings. \n\nPricing is based on the business's needs, for example, a (secure) basic 1-3 page business site with a domain name, email, SSL certificate, dedicated hosting, load-balancer, Google Analytics, basic SEO, monthly updates, and security patches starts at $79/mo and includes customer support. Need an e-commerce website? $199/mo + X amount for each product added. Need a CMS, CRM, blog posts, email marketing automation, enhanced firewall, more advanced SEO CTAs/Content, or monthly performance reports? No problem, let's work out a plan. \n\nMy question is, do you see this being profitable for both parties? I haven’t exactly tallied all the costs, but it should work from what I’m seeing. Is this something you would consider offloading in your business?","author":{"name":"SKPAdam"},"score":0,"numComments":2,"subreddit":{"display_name":"smallbusiness"},"permalink":"/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nh0yir/help_with_pricing_full_service_website_offering/","createdUtc":1757879391,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nh0yir/help_with_pricing_full_service_website_offering/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895606798,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1nh623j","title":"Anyone else feel like running Facebook/IG ads is way harder than it should be?","body":"My parents run a small shop, and every time they tried running Facebook ads, it ended the same way:\nHours spent clicking through confusing menus.\nMoney going out fast, with no idea what came back.\nEventually they gave up, saying “ads are just for big companies.”\n\nBut the thing is — Facebook and Instagram do work for small businesses… if you know what you’re doing. That’s the catch: most of us don’t have the time or background to run ads like a full-time marketer.\n\nI’ve been working with a small team on ways to make this easier.

{"id":"1nh5mbt","title":"Client not responding","body":"So close to a month ago I connected with an author about doing some commission work for them. They put up a post asking for artists, I responded, and they reached out. They seem nice but through the process the replies have been a bit less enthusiastic than I’m used to which is okay I just figured it was a difference in communication styles. I started the piece the first of the month and finished last weekend. They were kept up to date the whole time and responded every time within a few hours. As soon as I said I was putting the finishing touches on as long as everything still looked good last Sunday, I got no reply. I reached out Monday and again no reply. They post every single day both posts and on their stories. I waited til Friday and “checked in” and they said “everything looks great!” \nI responded again a few minutes after them and said “awesome! Are you able to pay this weekend?” And then gave them the price (which had already been discussed before I started). I actually have a 3 month payment policy for those who need it if they come from a previous clients referral or I know I can trust them. I think my work is a reasonable price (underpriced actually considering the market) but I know we’re all kind of paycheck to paycheck in the creative fields. However, they said before I started that they were more than happy to pay in full after the piece is complete (which is my usual process). \nThey have once again not responded the past few days. They still follow me so I don’t think they’re ghosting me or trying to steal but I’m just not sure what I’m supposed to do here lol. I understand needing more time to pay IF that were being communicated but I’m just getting silence. I don’t want to hound anyone for money but at the same time I communicated my expected timeline, they could see the pace of my work in real time, and everything was agreed on when I started. I know insta lets you schedule posts so I brushed off those as they probably scheduled their stuff ahead of time but that doesn’t account for the stories. Maybe they just get a lot of DMs bc they have close to 10k followers but again they’ve been responding consistently before this. Do I give them more time before reaching out again? What do I even say? 😂 I knew a situation like this would happen eventually and I’ve made it luckily a year without it being so but here we are.

{"id":"1nh2y3a","title":"New Retail Space - Ideas?","body":"So, I have the opportunity to rent a high traffic retail space (vehicle, not foot).  It's not on the market yet, and the owner is a friend of my family. \n\nRent: $2000\nSize: 600sq ft\nDetails: Includes 8 parking spaces, varying sizes.  Most are large and can accommodate up to a 24ft box truck\nLocation: Very heavy commercial / industrial zone, with tons of tractor trailers going through it since it's close to various ports and highways.  Tons of warehousing and manufacturing, low turnover, very rarely does anything retail-wise come on the market here.  So he's giving me 1st crack at it due to my experience opening and growing small businesses.\n\nBut let me tell you, this one has me stumped.\n\nOriginally I was thinking Bagel / Breakfast / Pizzeria space, but the build out is high since everything will need to be installed - HVAC, Fire Suppression, Good, etc.  At a minimum in the $150-200k range here in this area.  Also, I'm in the restaurant industry now and I'm tired of it.  Actually looking to sell that business.\n\nSo, Im here to see what suggestions ya'll have.  Here's what I came up with.\n\nNote, I'm trying to keep the build expenses as minimal as possible.  This isn't a project I planned for, so trying to keep my budget as low as possible.\n\n1. Bagel / Pizzeria - Offer Lotto, small convenience store, strictly to-do / delivery.  There's no room for seating.  Stay open 24/7 for the truckers and such, but plenty of gas stations in area that do the same. Pizza in the area is horrible. Very few places in NJ know how to make decent pizza (I'm Brooklyn raised, so I was spoiled).  And this area has probably the lowest of anything decent.  \n\n2. Pack & Ship - there are none in the area.  Closest is about 5 miles away.  I can add international shipping easily and rent a container to put in one of the parking spaces to increase package storage as well as inventory storage. Add mailbox rentals, printing / copying, notary, etc.\n\n3. Vehicle Rental - I'd have to put up an enclosed tent to be able to clean and work on the vehicles.  Thinking more commercial vehicles, vans and small box trucks.  But there is a Penske about 100 feet away and UHaul about 1 mile away.  I can rent a lot close by to store additional vehicles.  And I the  bring them to the location when they are rented.  So it would mainly be pick up / return location \n\nThat's it.  That's all I came up.\n\nOpen to suggestions.

Where do you set **minimums**, **after-hours rates**, and **on-site fees**?\n2. **Packages:** What simple, high-value bundles do SMBs actually buy (e.g., patching + AV/EDR + backups + helpdesk hours)?\n3. **Tools stack (starter, budget-friendly):**\n   * **Remote support/RMM:** what’s reliable and lean to start?\n   * **Ticketing/PSA + CRM:** keep it simple—any favorites?\n   * **Docs & passwords:** lightweight alternatives to ITGlue?\n   * **Monitoring/backups:** “good enough” baseline to start?\n4. **Contracts & SLAs:** Must-have clauses to avoid scope creep and burnout (response times, exclusions, data responsibilities, after-hours, emergency rates)?\n5. **Insurance:** What coverage did you consider non-negotiable (professional liability/E&O, cyber, general liability)?\n6. **Marketing that actually worked:** Google Business Profile + reviews, basic SEO, partnerships/referrals, content/case studies—what gave you the **first 10 solid clients**?\n7. **First hire:** Would you start with a **dispatcher/VA** (intake, billing, scheduling) or a **Level 1 tech**? Any milestones that told you “it’s time”?\n8. **Generalist vs. niche:** Stay broad at first, or pick a lane (e.g., Microsoft 365, Wi-Fi, compliance light, POS support) to stand out?\n9. **Boundaries while part-time:** How did you set expectations so clients still feel supported (published hours, emergency retainer, partner back-up)?\n10. **Biggest “I wish I’d known”** from your early days?\n\n# Current baseline (so you can calibrate your advice)\n\n* Solid remote + on-site troubleshooting, small office networks/Wi-Fi, basic cloud and backup setups.\n* Strong client satisfaction on communication and quality; I’m careful, thorough, and reliable.\n* Still building: formal contracts, standardized packages, PSA/RMM, and a consistent lead-gen channel.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing templates (sanitized): sample SoWs, onboarding checklists, simple SLAs, or starter tool lists would help a ton.

Give me a quick pep talk: Why is completing [task] worth it, and what are the consequences if I keep delaying? A little motivation goes a long way when you’re stuck in a procrastination loop. ~  \n    5. I keep putting off [task]. What might be causing this, and how can I overcome it right now? Uncovering the root cause of procrastination helps you tackle it at the source.\n\n[Source](https://www.agenticworkers.com/library/nj4sghza-procrastination-buster-toolkit)\n\nBefore running the prompt chain, replace the placeholder variables `{task}` , `{tasks}`, with your actual details\n\n(Each prompt is separated by \\~, make sure you run them separately, running this as a single prompt will not yield the best results)\n\nYou can pass that prompt chain directly into tools like [Agentic Worker](https://www.agenticworkers.com/library/nj4sghza-procrastination-buster-toolkit) to automatically queue it all together if you don't want to have to do it manually.)\n\n**Reminder About Limitations:**  \nThis chain is designed to help you tackle procrastination systematically, focusing on small, manageable steps and providing motivation. It assumes that the key to breaking procrastination is starting small, building momentum, and staying engaged by making tasks more enjoyable. Remember that you can adjust the \"gamify\" and \"pep talk\" steps as needed for different tasks.\n\nEnjoy!","author":"CalendarVarious3992","score":1,"numComments":2,"subreddit":"smallbusiness","permalink":"/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ngu4ai/overcome_procrastination_even_when_youre_having_a/","createdUtc":1757863531,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ngu4ai/overcome_procrastination_even_when_youre_having_a/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895606798,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1ngnkos","title":"Struggling with metal hurdle of downtime in my business -22M","body":"Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a 22year old from SoCal , and I’ve been in the car business since I was 18. I worked the dealership grind for years, learned the ins and outs, but eventually got tired of the long 12-hour days. So, I started my own wholesaling business.\n\nThe challenge I’ve been running into is that I was relying on third-party shops to fix up cars, but the costs were eating into my profits. Recently, the main shop I was using shut down  and since there’s really nothing like it around with the tools/equipment I need, I was basically forced to open my own shop.\n\nHere’s where the mental hurdle kicks in:\n\t•\tIt’s going to take me 2–3 months to get everything set up (lease, equipment, tools, etc.).\n\n\n\t•\tIn that time, I won’t really have income coming in — just expenses going out.\n\n\n\t•\tI do have a decent savings cushion (around $100K), but the thought of dipping below that after working so hard to save it is weighing on me.\n\n\n\t•\tThe hardest part is knowing I’ll just be sitting around with no “productive” work for weeks, and my mind keeps circling back to the money and the downtime.\n\nI know long term I’ll be fine, and the business will make that money back and more (hopefully lol). But right now it’s the mental side that’s eating at me feeling unproductive, stressed about cash flow, and impatient to just get going again.\n\nSo my question is: What would you do in my situation?\n\n\n\t•\tDo I just grit my teeth and thug it out for a few months?\n\n\n\t•\tAny tips for dealing with the mental toll of downtime and watching savings dip while building something?\n\n\n\t•\tIf you’ve been through something similar, how did you push through?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice or perspective.\n\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention the difference per copy, using a shop I average around 1,500 per vehicle sold, if I get my own shop it’s around 2,500-3,000 per vehicle sold.

The rest just keep going the old way.\n\nWhat’s even stranger is watching teams struggle under the weight of all this busywork missing leads, falling behind on projects, constantly fighting the clock while the tools that would help them are right there.\n\nSometimes they even push back when someone suggests it. Not because of money, at least not always, but because **it feels safer to keep things in their own hands than to trust a system**.\n\nI can’t tell if this is just habit, fear of change, or something deeper about how people think about control.\n\nSo **I’m curious if you’re in a business or a team, do you actually use automation?** \n\nI don’t mean the default stuff everyone gets by accident, but the kind you set up on purpose to save yourself time.

To summarize everything I used to work for someone as an employee a while back, this was a trade business and I learned my foundation for everything I know now from them. They showed me the trade and eventually I ended up in bad terms due to differences between us. I was let go / left ( If you ask him he will say he fired me, if you ask me my truth is I took my tools and quit)  from that company over year ago. Shortly after this , I started my own business and went full on legit and insured doing the same thing, met many more people along the way and business has been good but it’s been way away from “his area” , recently I got my first couple jobs for a home builder within 5-6 miles from his shop. I did the jobs for them and also was informed they used to do business with them but not any longer, well recently he got in contact with a project manager who is a completely different person than the person I’ve been dealing with, anyways he is now starting to do projects for that home building company again ( we both got hired for a total of 3-5 projects- I got 3 and he got 2 )  and has found out now that I am the other company  bidding those jobs which is why he didn’t get them and he has told me that I am to stay away from his area otherwise “it will be bad” \nI asked him what he meant by this and he said personal things type of bad ( I am currently towards the end of my probation period for a conviction from almost 2 years ago) and he said he would get cops involved / probation officer and such basically just anything to try to make my life harder. He told me I am to immediately stop doing business with that contractor because it is “his” contractor. He also said if I get any phone calls what so ever from within his radius / area that i should be handing those leads over to him and if I do this I will be in “good terms with him” otherwise it will be very bad for me. \n\nI am infuriated and very upset about this. I do have several legal issues right now that are finally starting to get resolved. ( I am not a repeat felon or anything like this, all of these issues are things that have been of consequence from my conviction) I have bettered my life and built my business and I want to just live my life in peace and make a living for my family and I.   I wish I could just tell him no but I feel like I have just as much to lose if he sabotages my business or finds some way to get me in trouble compared to if I pursue business in his area ( just from this home building company I will lose thousands of dollars in business over the years if I close ties with them) This area is a very wealthy area and great opportunities for my business there and I’m sure this is why he wants me away from here. I am considering just doing what he wants and staying away from that area but please if anyone has any advice please comment. Thank you everyone.

{"id":"1nghztc","title":"One-person marketing team at a small Utah company — $28/hr, no benefits. Am I being undervalued?","body":"I work for a small company in Northern Utah. Lately, a few things have made me start questioning whether I’m really being paid what I’m worth — and whether this setup is worth it at all. I guess what I’m really asking is: Is this a fair setup for my role and location, or am I getting underpaid and undervalued?\n\nI am the Media and Marketing Manager — though really, I am the entire marketing team. We’re in a niche service industry with about 20 employees total, including technicians. I’ve been here just over 20 months, but the company has been around a few years shy of a decade.\n\nFor context, this is my first real job in the marketing industry. Before this, I worked at a large, corporate utility billing management company as a team lead making $25/hr. I had been trying to transition into a marketing role for a while, but every internal application was rejected due to my lack of direct marketing experience. When this current company offered to take a chance on me, I jumped on it — but I also had no idea how to value myself at the time. It was a risk for both myself AND the company.\n\nPrior to my coming onboard, marketing and content creation efforts were delegated to the sales manager (with little to no experience), with a few attempts at outsourcing the marketing for a while with very little ROI. When I was brought on, the position was made FOR me. I handle everything from planning and filming content and ads, to editing, posting, and managing them. In addition to this, anything on the technical or creative side is generally given to me as that’s in my wheelhouse (such as the art side of changing our vehicle wraps, I created an instant quote tool for our company’s website, etc).\n\nMy wage is $28/hr and I’m not salaried. As for benefits:\n\n* There's no work-sponsored insurance, though finally some talk of shopping around for quotes.\n* A 401K plan existed when I joined, but it’s since been cancelled.\n* Holidays aren’t paid — if you take the day off, you don’t get paid.\n* PTO is minimal. You get nothing until your 1-year mark. After that, it’s just 40 hours per year, added on each work anniversary. No sick leave or separate holidays.\n\nOn the plus side, we’re a small and tight-knit company. That means there’s a lot of leniency from the boss when it comes to work hours, time off (albeit unpaid), and general flexibility.\n\nThis last week my wife and I were hit with a really bad case of COVID that made it very, very difficult to work. I had already used my 40 hours of PTO for this, my second year with the company, and therefore this week is mostly going unpaid. I’ve just begun to realize I may not be getting paid what I’m worth.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is this normal for small companies in general — or for Utah? Or am I right to feel undervalued?","author":"-ThatGingerKid-","score":2,"numComments":12,"subreddit":"smallbusiness","permalink":"/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nghztc/oneperson_marketing_team_at_a_small_utah_company/","createdUtc":1757824637,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nghztc/oneperson_marketing_team_at_a_small_utah_company/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895606799,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

For the last three months, my business partner, and I have been running the company we were able to pick up for next to nothing due to the owner, wanting to retire and not shut down the business. We were originally supposed to split all work and profits 50-50 to maintain the company and get it up to 100% Production. As of the last three weeks, my partner has been spending more time at his full-time job and I have been spending nearly 100% of my time in the company. We have not yet signed over the LLC from the original owner as we had a trial run to see if we would like the business or not. I want to continue to run the company and grow into its full potential but I’m not sure if a 50-50 partnership is fair with my partner working a full-time job and trying to manage his responsibilities with this company my question is would it be disingenuous of me to take over the LLC at my 51% ownership and give him 49 until he can come award 100% of his time? The original plan was to build the company large enough to where he could quit his full-time job and become a board. Has anyone dealt with anything similar?

{"id":"1ngd8nq","title":"Quick Service Seating","body":"My parent's run a small sushi business in a small town that I help with 6 days a week while being a full time student at a college. About 5-6 months ago in April, we left out old business location because of issues with the landlord. We already secured our new space a month prior before we left our old location. It's in the same town but different buildings. However, the landlord in our new location does not allow dine-in. My parents and I were fine with takeout only since most of our sales were take out in the old location. We were just happy that we found a space in the same town that we did business in for many many years. \n\nRecently, a new tenant came in to the other space that was for lease. Originally, there were two spaces open for lease. One of them being the space that my parent's and I are occupying currently and another one that the other tenant is occupying. She is opening a Mediterranean take out restaurant. I remember the realtor telling me about something about dine in and going to the borough and asking them. Anyways, the new tenant told us that she talked to the zoning director from the borough and she said that my parent's and I should team up with the new tenant and get the same lawyer to submit a Variance application because the realtor told her that she could do that or something. This way, the cost for getting quick service dine in is a lot cheaper since we're splitting it half and half and we didn't need two different lawyers to be involved with the same thing.. \n\nLike I said before, my parent's and I were fine with takeout only since our last business was around 85-90% takeout. But since the new tenant told us that she was going to apply for the quick service dine in. My mom immediately said that she was also going to do it too. So the new tenant told us to meet at this specific day at this specific office to talk to the lawyer she hired. \n\nAnyways, the lawyer talked with the zoning director and he warned us that many previous tenants came to the borough with the same desire as us for in door seating but backed away because how much it costed and how long it took. I'm expecting the price to be around $12K. Maybe even more and I'm assuming this all includes with the lawyer fee, the parking study, the fees for an engineer to draw the study since no one has done it before ever, the application itself, and the cost of copying the property prior site plans. I'm also assuming that it's gonna take about a few months like around 4-5 months to a year since we have to show it to court for them to look at and approve it. \n\nEven though my parent's and I have a long history of doing our business in town, there is still a good chance that the town won't approve it. I'm 100% sure. My mom keeps saying that the borough is going to accept it because of our long history. But I keep telling her that the court doesn't care if we have a long history. They're not going to be biased and look at the application the same. So I get angry at her as we go back and forth and keeps mentioning the new tenant saying that even if it's gonna cost 12-13K the town is going to allow it and once we do it ourselves, the town isn't gonna allow us the indoor seating. She also keeps mentioning how once we sell the business, it's gonna cost more with in door seating rather than without. \n\nMy parents are the type of people that goes head in first before actually thinking about it throughly and I personally have a bad feeling with doing this because I personally think they're going to reject it and then 7K will go down the drain. And my mom is going to blame it all on me.

Eventually they gave up, saying “ads are just for big companies.”\n But the thing is — Facebook and Instagram do work for small businesses… if you know what you’re doing.

I feel like if we can crack this, SMBs could actually get value from ads without feeling ripped off.\n    submitted by    /u/rob_the_boss  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"smallbusiness","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nh623j/anyone_else_feel_like_running_facebookig_ads_is/","createdUtc":1757895601.351,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nh623j/anyone_else_feel_like_running_facebookig_ads_is/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601351,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":35,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":20,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":35}}}

They put up a post asking for artists, I responded, and they reached out. They seem nice but through the process the replies have been a bit less enthusiastic than I’m used to which is okay I just figured it was a difference in communication styles. I started the piece the first of the month and finished last weekend. They were kept up to date the whole time and responded every time within a few hours. As soon as I said I was putting the finishing touches on as long as everything still looked good last Sunday, I got no reply. I reached out Monday and again no reply. They post every single day both posts and on their stories. I waited til Friday and “checked in” and they said “everything looks great!” I responded again a few minutes after them and said “awesome! Are you able to pay this weekend?” And then gave them the price (which had already been discussed before I started). I actually have a 3 month payment policy for those who need it if they come from a previous clients referral or I know I can trust them. I think my work is a reasonable price (underpriced actually considering the market) but I know we’re all kind of paycheck to paycheck in the creative fields. However, they said before I started that they were more than happy to pay in full after the piece is complete (which is my usual process). They have once again not responded the past few days. They still follow me so I don’t think they’re ghosting me or trying to steal but I’m just not sure what I’m supposed to do here lol. I understand needing more time to pay IF that were being communicated but I’m just getting silence. I don’t want to hound anyone for money but at the same time I communicated my expected timeline, they could see the pace of my work in real time, and everything was agreed on when I started. I know insta lets you schedule posts so I brushed off those as they probably scheduled their stuff ahead of time but that doesn’t account for the stories. Maybe they just get a lot of DMs bc they have close to 10k followers but again they’ve been responding consistently before this. Do I give them more time before reaching out again? What do I even say? 😂 I knew a situation like this would happen eventually and I’ve made it luckily a year without it being so but here we are.

{"id":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nh2y3a/new_retail_space_ideas/","title":"New Retail Space - Ideas?","body":"So, I have the opportunity to rent a high traffic retail space (vehicle, not foot). It's not on the market yet, and the owner is a friend of my family. \n Rent: $2000 Size: 600sq ft Details: Includes 8 parking spaces, varying sizes. Most are large and can accommodate up to a 24ft box truck Location: Very heavy commercial / industrial zone, with tons of tractor trailers going through it since it's close to various ports and highways. Tons of warehousing and manufacturing, low turnover, very rarely does anything retail-wise come on the market here. So he's giving me 1st crack at it due to my experience opening and growing small businesses.\n But let me tell you, this one has me stumped.\n Originally I was thinking Bagel / Breakfast / Pizzeria space, but the build out is high since everything will need to be installed - HVAC, Fire Suppression, Good, etc. At a minimum in the $150-200k range here in this area. Also, I'm in the restaurant industry now and I'm tired of it. Actually looking to sell that business.\n So, Im here to see what suggestions ya'll have. Here's what I came up with.\n Note, I'm trying to keep the build expenses as minimal as possible. This isn't a project I planned for, so trying to keep my budget as low as possible.\n  \nBagel / Pizzeria - Offer Lotto, small convenience store, strictly to-do / delivery. There's no room for seating. Stay open 24/7 for the truckers and such, but plenty of gas stations in area that do the same. Pizza in the area is horrible. Very few places in NJ know how to make decent pizza (I'm Brooklyn raised, so I was spoiled). And this area has probably the lowest of anything decent. \n \nPack & Ship - there are none in the area. Closest is about 5 miles away. I can add international shipping easily and rent a container to put in one of the parking spaces to increase package storage as well as inventory storage. Add mailbox rentals, printing / copying, notary, etc.\n \nVehicle Rental - I'd have to put up an enclosed tent to be able to clean and work on the vehicles.

{"id":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nh0yir/help_with_pricing_full_service_website_offering/","title":"Help with pricing full service website offering","body":"I'm a software contractor based in the US. I’ve built, released, and even own — SaaS products, apps, and websites for over a decade. For a while now, I've been orchestrating some architecture to assist me in setting up and managing websites for small businesses in a sane way (for both parties). Essentially, handling everything from setup and release to maintenance, updates, and beyond. I'm hoping that by offering this basic service at an economical price, I can become their go-to resource for tech-related problems, growing alongside them, rather than on their behalf.\n That said, there are a lot of Wix-type offerings that help non-technical people build their own website at the cost of vendor lock-in and technical limitations — but I still find people hiring devs to create these poorly made, bloated sites (that businesses can't even take with them) on their behalf; either because they still don't have an eye for design, or simply do not have the time (they are running a business after all).\n Even after that, business owners have to pay someone to update and fix things when things go sideways. This can be a major headache for them because, frankly, most small business owners are rightfully clueless when it comes to what exactly is going wrong with their website, and by the time they coordinate an emergency fix, it can be days later and hours of labor that is not spent on running their core business. As you can imagine, this can be extremely stressful for a blue-collar contractor, restaurant, or shop owner to handle.\n Many “website designers”' business models involve large upfront costs for design and setup, which usually amount to taking pre-built templates (or services like Wix) and then adding the business's content, and then sending clients on their way to fend for themselves. After years of witnessing these shakedowns (of friends, family, and clients), I’ve finally identified and built a solution to remove the stress, spread the costs, and remove the large upfront investment businesses incur to get things up and running “the right way”. \n I'm currently piloting a new “websites made easy” subscription program geared towards business owners entering the market, or those looking to do things the right way their second/third time around. We take care of everything; the client just tells us what they want, then we build it and update it for them as required. Obviously, there are some limitations that we can account for, à la carte — i.e., increased frequency of content updates (I was leaning towards 1 update cycle per month), advanced features - such as dynamic event or specials sections, additional email addresses or domain names, or even mailing list features. Just about anything is possible because we are building you a true custom website, not limited by a large service provider's offerings. \n Pricing is based on the business's needs, for example, a (secure) basic 1-3 page business site with a domain name, email, SSL certificate, dedicated hosting, load-balancer, Google Analytics, basic SEO, monthly updates, and security patches starts at $79/mo and includes customer support. Need an e-commerce website? $199/mo + X amount for each product added. Need a CMS, CRM, blog posts, email marketing automation, enhanced firewall, more advanced SEO CTAs/Content, or monthly performance reports? No problem, let's work out a plan. \n My question is, do you see this being profitable for both parties? I haven’t exactly tallied all the costs, but it should work from what I’m seeing. Is this something you would consider offloading in your business?\n    submitted by    /u/SKPAdam  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"smallbusiness","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nh0yir/help_with_pricing_full_service_website_offering/","createdUtc":1757895601.351,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1nh0yir/help_with_pricing_full_service_website_offering/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601351,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":50,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":30,"contextScore":5,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":50}}}

{"id":"1ndpv4f","title":"A Rant About Multiprocessing","body":"The simplest system architecture is a single, monolithic process. This is the gold standard of all possible architectures. Why is it a thing worthy of reverence? Because it involves a single programming language and no interprocess communication, i.e. a messaging library. Software development doesn’t get more carefree than life within the safe confines of a single process.\n\nIn the age of websites and cloud computing, instances of monolithic implementations are rare. Even an HTTP server presenting queries to a database server is technically two processes and a client library. There are other factors that push system design to multiprocessing, like functional separation, physical distribution and concurrency. So realistically, the typical architecture is a multiprocessing architecture.\n\nWhat is it about multiprocessing that bumps an architecture off the top of the list of places-I’d-rather-be? At the architectural level, the responsibility for starting and managing processes may be carried by a third-party such as Kubernetes - making it something of a non-issue. No, the real problems with multiprocessing start when the processes start communicating with each other.\n\nConsider that HTTP server paired with a database server. A single call to the HTTP server involves 5 type systems and 4 encoding/decoding operations. That’s kinda crazy. Every item of data - such as a floating-point value - exists at different times in 5 different forms, and very specific code fragments are involved in transformations between runtime variables (e.g. Javascript, Python and C++) and portable representations (e.g. JSON and protobuf).\n\nIt’s popular to refer to architectures like these as layered, or as a software stack. If a Javascript application is at the top level of a stack and a database query language is at the lowest level, then all the type capability within the different type systems, must align, i.e. floats, datetimes and user-defined types (e.g. Person) must move up and down the stack without loss of integrity. Basic types such as booleans, integers and strings are fairly well supported (averting the engineers gaze from 32-bit vs 64-bit integers and floats), but support gets rocky with types often referred to as generics, e.g. vectors/lists, arrays and maps/dicts. The chances of a map of Person objects, indexed on a UUID, passing seamlessly from Javascript application to database client library are extremely low. Custom transformations invariably take up residence in your codebase.\n\nDue diligence on your stack involves detailed research, prototyping and unit tests. Edge cases can be nasty, such as when a 64-bit serial id is passed into a type system that only supports 32-bits. Datetime values are particularly fraught. Bugs associated with these cases can surface after months of fault-free operation. The presence of unit tests at all levels drags your development velocity down.\n\nNext up is the style of interaction that a client has with the system, e.g. with the HTTP server. The modern software stack has evolved to handle CRUD-like requests over a database model. This is a blocking, request-response interaction and it has been incredibly effective. It is less effective at delivering services that do not fit this mold. What if your Javascript client wants to open a window that displays a stream of monitoring device events? How does your system propagate operational errors up to the appropriate administrator?\n\nTogether, HTTP and Javascript now provide a range of options in this space, such as the Push API, Server-side Events, HTTP/2 Server Push and Websockets, with possibly the latter providing the cleanest basis for universal two-way, asynchronous messaging. Sadly, that still leaves a lot of work to do - what encoding is to be used, what type system is available (e.g. the JSON encoding has no datetime) and how are multiple conversations multiplexed over the single websocket connection? Who or what are the entities engaged in these conversations, because there must be someone or something - right?\n\nThe ability to multiplex multiple conversations influences the internal architecture of your processes. Without matching sophistication in the communicating parties, a multi-lane freeway is a high-volume transport to the same old choke points. Does anyone know a good software entity framework?\n\nThere are further demands on the capabilities of the messaging facility. Processes such as the HTTP server are a point of access for external processes. Optimal support for a complex, multi-view client would have multiple entry points available providing direct access to the relevant processes. Concerns about security may force the merging of the multiple points into a single point. That point of access would need to make the necessary internal connections and provide the ongoing routing of message streams to their ultimate destinations.\n\nLastly, the adoption of multiple programming languages not only requires the matching linguistic skills but also breaks the homogeneous nature of your system. Consider a simple bubble diagram where each bubble is a process and each arrow represents a connection from one process to the other. The ability to add arrows anywhere assumes the availability of the same messaging system in every process, and therefore, every language.\n\nMultiprocessing with a multiplexing communications framework can deliver the systems environment that we might subconsciously lust after. But where is that framework and what would it even look like?\n\nWell, the link in the post takes you to the docs for my best attempt.\n\n","author":{"name":"Public_Being3163"},"score":0,"numComments":8,"subreddit":{"display_name":"programming"},"permalink":"/r/programming/comments/1ndpv4f/a_rant_about_multiprocessing/","createdUtc":1757537298,"url":"https://kipjak-manual.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1.0.0/index.html","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895610473,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

Netflix's microservices don't just monitor CPU and memory—they track business metrics like recommendation accuracy and user engagement rates.\n\n**Circuit Breaker Integration**: When a service's error rate crosses 50%, circuit breakers automatically isolate it while healing mechanisms activate. This prevents cascade failures during recovery.\n\n**Behavioral Anomaly Detection**: Systems learn normal patterns and detect deviations. A sudden 300% increase in database query time triggers healing before users notice slowness.\n\n# Decision: The Healing Brain\n\nThe decision engine determines the appropriate response based on failure type, system state, and historical success rates of different recovery strategies.\n\n**Recovery Strategy Selection**: Memory leaks trigger instance replacement, while network issues trigger retry with exponential backoff. Database connection exhaustion triggers connection pool scaling.\n\n**Risk Assessment**: Before taking action, the system evaluates potential impact. Restarting a critical service during peak hours might cause more damage than the original problem.\n\n# Action: The Healing Hands\n\nRecovery actions range from gentle adjustments to aggressive interventions, always prioritizing system stability over perfect recovery.\n\n**Graceful Degradation**: Instead of complete failure, systems reduce functionality. YouTube serves lower-quality videos when CDN nodes fail rather than showing error pages.\n\n**Progressive Recovery**: Healing happens incrementally.

Think about the fact that these systems are designed to withstand the loss of any single computer-host or even data-centre. Hardware-failures therefore (by themselves), shouldn’t be able to cause an outage (unless perfectly coordinated). Therefore, even if some disruption was originally caused by some hardware-issue (like a failing host or generator), the overall system was designed (and probably tested) to survive these sort of problems, yet it failed to do so. These changes are configuration-changes, which are “rolled out” unexpectedly and instantaneously.\n\nIf our system shared a single, global timeline across both its data and its configuration and both data and configuration lived separately from its executing environment (i.e.: virtualised perfectly), another system could have trivially taken the place of the one experiencing the outage.

{"id":"1ngwm1p","title":"Nytril: A programming language and a markup language in one","body":"Nytril has a unique syntax that makes it easy to create complex documents from the results of your code. There are no \"Write\" or \"Print\" statements. The results of each expression simply become a part of the document.\n\nHere are some of the standout features and new concepts:\n\n  \n**global functions and namespaces**\n\nNytril allows global functions that do not belong to a class and have no 'this' pointer. They can also be defined inside of a namespace.\n\n    F1(x) = x + 1;      // F1 defined globally\n    N1.F2(x) = x + 2;   // F2 defined inside the namespace N1\n    namespace N2 {\n      F3(x) = x + 3;    // F3 defined inside the namespace N2\n    }\n    namespace N2 {     // N2 can be repeated\n      F4(x) = x + 4;   // F3 and F4 are now a part of N2 \n    }\n\n**readonly global functions**\n\nIf a global function is marked as `readonly`, then the function is run the first time it is called anywhere in the program, and the return value is cached. If the function is called again anywhere, the cached value from the first run is returned immediately. This is useful when loading large constant values such as images or the results of database queries or REST calls, where the intention is usually to retrieve information once and then use the same copy for many calculations.\n\n    readonly Data = ComplexSlowQuery;           // Run only once\n    readonly Cost = Data.Quantity * Data.Price; // Use like a variable\n\n**Affinity operator**\n\nTo create complex formatted text in an easy way, Nytril introduced the affinity operator. In most programming languages, two operands must be separated by a binary operator (e.g. x \\* y) or else there is a syntax error. In Nytril, if the compiler encounters two operands without a binary operator between them, it inserts an invisible binary 'affinity' operator and continues without error. At runtime, the type of the two operands is assessed and if an affinity exists between the two types, the operation is executed. If there is no affinity between the types, there is a runtime error.\n\n    \"123\" \"abc\"\n     ⇒ \"123\" + \"abc\"\n\n3 meters\n\n ⇒ 3 \\* meters\n\nNytril allows the programmer to add left and right affinity between objects of different types, which can create a complex sub-grammar in the language which can increase clarity.\n\n**The 'each' Operator**\n\nThe `each` operator is used to call a function with a parameter once for every item in an array. The resulting expression is an array of function return values.\n\n`Square(x) = x * x;`  \n`Square(each [1, 2, 3, 4]);`\n\n ⇒ \\[1, 4, 9, 16\\]\n\nIf a function has more than 1 parameter, the each operator can be used on more than 1 argument. This raises the dimension of the output array.\n\n    Power(x, power) = x ^ power;\n    Power(each [1, 2, 3], each [1, 2, 3]);\n\n ⇒ \\[\\[1, 4, 9\\], \\[1, 4, 9\\], \\[1, 8, 27\\]\\];\n\nMost unary and binary operators can also be used in conjunction with the each operator to provide a very compact expression.\n\n    (each [1, 2, 3]) ^ (each [1, 2, 3])\n\n ⇒ \\[\\[1, 2, 3\\], \\[1, 4, 9\\], \\[1, 8, 27\\]\\];\n\n**Revisions**\n\nA revision is a collection of properties and elements inside curly braces `{}` that are separated by semi-colons (;}. A property is a \"name: value\" pair such as `TextHeight: 12 pts`. An element is any other expression, including variables and values returned from function calls. The properties and elements of a revision are computed at runtime, so a revision \"executes\" just like a scope in a function.\n\nA revision adds elements to, and modifies the properties of, format objects in a document. A revision acts on the format object to its left, without modifying it. The combination of the left-hand operand and the right-hand revision is a new revised object that has the properties and elements of the left-hand format/revision plus any additional elements of the right-hand revision, and the added (or overridden) properties of the right-hand revision. By stacking and combining revisions, hierarchical style dictionaries can be created easily in a manner that is similar to [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) or to the way word processors allow styles to inherit from each other and override properties.\n\nThe following code creates a empty `Paragraph` and revises it with content and properties. The placement of properties has no effect, but the placement of elements is always in order.\n\n    Paragraph {1; 2; 3; \"abc\"; TextColor: Colors.Blue};\n\n ⇒ 123abc\n\nThe following code creates a paragraph 'style' called Heading1 by revising the `Paragraph` format with several properties.

{"id":"1ng8xio","title":"TargetJS: a UI framework where time is declarative (no async/await chains)","body":"I’ve been building a small JavaScript UI framework called **TargetJS** and would love feedback from this community. It takes a fundamentally different approach to front-end development, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations and complex UI flows.\n\nThe core idea is that it unifies everything—UI, state, APIs, and animations—into a single concept called \"targets.\" Instead of using async/await or chaining promises and callbacks, the execution flow is determined by two simple postfixes:\n\n* **$ (Reactive):** Runs every time the preceding target updates.\n* **$$ (Deferred):** Runs only after the preceding targets have fully completed all their operations.\n\nThis means you can write a complex sequence of events, like \"add button -> animate it -> when done add another element -> animate that -> when done fetch API -> show user data\" and the code reads almost like a step-by-step list, top-to-bottom. The framework handles all the asynchronous \"plumbing\" for you.\n\nI think it works really well for applications with a lot of animation or real-time data fetching such as games, interactive dashboards, or rich single-page apps, where managing state and async operations can become a headache.\n\nWhat do you think of this approach? Have you seen anything similar?\n\n**Links:**\n\n* **GitHub:** [https://github.com/livetrails/targetjs](https://github.com/livetrails/targetjs)\n* **Website:** [https://targetjs.io](https://targetjs.io)","author":"Various-Beautiful417","score":20,"numComments":35,"subreddit":"programming","permalink":"/r/programming/comments/1ng8xio/targetjs_a_ui_framework_where_time_is_declarative/","createdUtc":1757797992,"url":"https://github.com/livetrails/targetjs","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895610473,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1nf6df3","title":"“I Got Pwned”: npm maintainer of Chalk & Debug speaks on the massive supply-chain attack","body":"Hey Everyone,  \nThis week I posted our discovery of finding that a popular open-source projects, including debug and chalk had been breached. I'm happy to say the Josh (Qix) the maintainer that was compromised agreed to sit down with me and discuss his experience, it was a very candid conversation but one I think was important to have.\n\nBelow are some of the highlight and takeaways from the conversation, since the “how could this happen?” question is still circulating.\n\n**Was MFA on the account?**\n\n“There was definitely MFA… but timed one-time passwords are not phishing resistant. They can be man in the middle. There’s no cryptographic checks, no domain association, nothing like U2F would have.”\n\nThe attackers used a fake NPM login flow and captured his TOTP, allowing them to fully impersonate him. Josh called out not enabling phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/U2F) as his biggest technical mistake.\n\n**The scale of the blast radius**\n\nCharlie (our researcher) spotted the issue while triaging suspicious packages:\n\n“First I saw the debug package… then I saw chalk and error-ex… and I knew a significant portion of the JS ecosystem would be impacted.”\n\nWiz later reported that **99% of cloud environments used at least one affected package**.\n\n“The fact it didn’t do anything was the bullet we dodged. It ran in CI/CD, on laptops, servers, enterprise machines. It could have done anything.”\n\nWiz also reported that 10% of cloud environments they analyzed had the malware inside them. There were some 'hot takes' on the internet that, in fact this was not a big deal and some said it was a win for security. Josh shared that this was not a win and the only reason we got away with it was because how ineffective the attackers were. The malicious packages were downloaded 2.5 million times in the 2 hour window they were live.\n\n**Ecosystem-level shortcomings**\n\nJosh was frank about registry response times and missing safeguards:\n\n“There was a huge process breakdown during this attack with NPM. Extremely slow to respond. No preemptive ‘switch to U2F’ push despite billions of downloads. I had no recourse except filing a ticket through their public form.\"\n\nJosh also gave some advice for anyone going through this in the future which is to be open and transparent, the internet largely agreed Josh handled this in the best way possible (short of not getting phished in the first place )\n\n“If you screw up, own it. In open source, being transparent and immediate saves a lot of people’s time and money. Vulnerability (the human kind) goes a long way.”","author":"Advocatemack","score":190,"numComments":31,"subreddit":"programming","permalink":"/r/programming/comments/1nf6df3/i_got_pwned_npm_maintainer_of_chalk_debug_speaks/","createdUtc":1757691175,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdUKJ-4y2zo","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895610473,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1nef09j","title":"Managing HTTP Requests as Type-Safe TypeScript Classes","body":"# Background: Common Pain Points\n\nWhen writing HTTP requests in TypeScript projects, we often encounter these issues:\n\n* **Scattered code**: URLs, headers, and query strings end up spread across different parts of the codebase.\n* **Inconsistent styles**: Each developer writes request functions differently. Some mutate input values inside the function, others use external utilities. → This leads to poor reusability and harder maintenance.\n* **Operational differences**: When working with many APIs, each API may have slightly different timeout and retry policies. Hardcoding these policies into each function quickly becomes messy.\n* **Readability issues**: It’s not always clear whether a given value is a path parameter, query string, or header. Different developers define them differently, and long-term maintenance of a shared codebase becomes harder.\n\n# The Question: How to Make It More Efficient\n\nTo solve these issues, I needed **consistency** and **declarative definitions**:\n\n* Define request structures in a declarative way so the whole team follows the same pattern.\n* Specify timeout, retry, and other operational policies cleanly at the request level.\n* Make it obvious at a glance whether a value belongs to the path, query, header, or body.\n\n# What Worked for Me\n\nThe most effective approach was to define HTTP requests as **classes**, with **decorators that clearly describe structure and policies**:\n\n* Use u/Get, u/Post, u/Param, u/Query, u/Header, u/Body to define the request.\n* Attach operational policies like timeout and retry directly to the request class.\n* Reading the class immediately reveals what is path/query/header/body.\n\nAfter several iterations, I built a library around this approach: [jin-frame](https://github.com/imjuni/jin-frame).\n\njin-frame lets you design HTTP requests as TypeScript classes, similar to how ORMs like TypeORM or MikroORM let you design entities.\n\n    import { Get, Param, Query, JinFrame } from 'jin-frame';\n    import { randomUUID } from 'node:crypto';\n    \n    u/Get({ \n      host: 'https://pokeapi.co',\n      path: '/api/v2/pokemon/:name',\n    })\n    export class PokemonFrame extends JinFrame {\n      @Param()\n      declare public readonly name: string;\n    \n      @Query()\n      declare public readonly tid: string;\n    }\n    \n    (async () => {\n      const frame = PokemonFrame.of({ \n        name: 'pikachu', \n        tid: randomUUID(),\n      });\n      const reply = await frame.execute();\n      \n      // Show Pikachu Data\n      console.log(reply.data);\n    })();\n\n* @Param() maps a value into the path (:name).\n* @Query() maps a value into the querystring (?tid=...).\n* Calling execute() performs the request and returns the JSON response.\n\n\n\n# Closing Thoughts (Revised)\n\nI’ve been using this library personally for quite a while, and it has proven to be genuinely useful in my own projects. That’s why I decided to share [jin-frame](https://github.com/imjuni/jin-frame) with other developers — not just as a finished tool, but as something that can continue to improve.\n\nIf you give it a try and share your feedback, it would be a great opportunity to make this library even better. I hope jin-frame can be helpful in your projects too, and I’d love to hear how it works for you.","author":"imjuni","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"programming","permalink":"/r/programming/comments/1nef09j/managing_http_requests_as_typesafe_typescript/","createdUtc":1757611803,"url":"https://github.com/imjuni/jin-frame","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895610473,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

It takes a fundamentally different approach to front-end development, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations and complex UI flows.\n The core idea is that it unifies everything—UI, state, APIs, and animations—into a single concept called \"targets.\" Instead of using async/await or chaining promises and callbacks, the execution flow is determined by two simple postfixes:\n  \n$ (Reactive): Runs every time the preceding target updates.\n $$ (Deferred): Runs only after the preceding targets have fully completed all their operations.\n  \nThis means you can write a complex sequence of events, like \"add button -> animate it -> when done add another element -> animate that -> when done fetch API -> show user data\" and the code reads almost like a step-by-step list, top-to-bottom. The framework handles all the asynchronous \"plumbing\" for you.\n I think it works really well for applications with a lot of animation or real-time data fetching such as games, interactive dashboards, or rich single-page apps, where managing state and async operations can become a headache.\n What do you think of this approach?

{"id":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ngwm1p/nytril_a_programming_language_and_a_markup/","title":"Nytril: A programming language and a markup language in one","body":"Nytril has a unique syntax that makes it easy to create complex documents from the results of your code. There are no \"Write\" or \"Print\" statements. The results of each expression simply become a part of the document.\n Here are some of the standout features and new concepts:\n global functions and namespaces\n Nytril allows global functions that do not belong to a class and have no 'this' pointer. They can also be defined inside of a namespace.\n F1(x) = x + 1; // F1 defined globally N1.F2(x) = x + 2; // F2 defined inside the namespace N1 namespace N2 { F3(x) = x + 3; // F3 defined inside the namespace N2 } namespace N2 { // N2 can be repeated F4(x) = x + 4; // F3 and F4 are now a part of N2 } \n readonly global functions\n If a global function is marked as readonly, then the function is run the first time it is called anywhere in the program, and the return value is cached. If the function is called again anywhere, the cached value from the first run is returned immediately. This is useful when loading large constant values such as images or the results of database queries or REST calls, where the intention is usually to retrieve information once and then use the same copy for many calculations.\n readonly Data = ComplexSlowQuery; // Run only once readonly Cost = Data.Quantity * Data.Price; // Use like a variable \n Affinity operator\n To create complex formatted text in an easy way, Nytril introduced the affinity operator. In most programming languages, two operands must be separated by a binary operator (e.g. x * y) or else there is a syntax error. In Nytril, if the compiler encounters two operands without a binary operator between them, it inserts an invisible binary 'affinity' operator and continues without error. At runtime, the type of the two operands is assessed and if an affinity exists between the two types, the operation is executed. If there is no affinity between the types, there is a runtime error.\n \"123\" \"abc\" ⇒ \"123\" + \"abc\" \n 3 meters\n  ⇒ 3 * meters\n Nytril allows the programmer to add left and right affinity between objects of different types, which can create a complex sub-grammar in the language which can increase clarity.\n The 'each' Operator\n The each operator is used to call a function with a parameter once for every item in an array. The resulting expression is an array of function return values.\n Square(x) = x * x;\n Square(each [1, 2, 3, 4]);\n  ⇒ [1, 4, 9, 16]\n If a function has more than 1 parameter, the each operator can be used on more than 1 argument. This raises the dimension of the output array.\n Power(x, power) = x ^ power; Power(each [1, 2, 3], each [1, 2, 3]); \n  ⇒ [[1, 4, 9], [1, 4, 9], [1, 8, 27]];\n Most unary and binary operators can also be used in conjunction with the each operator to provide a very compact expression.\n (each [1, 2, 3]) ^ (each [1, 2, 3]) \n  ⇒ [[1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9], [1, 8, 27]];\n Revisions\n A revision is a collection of properties and elements inside curly braces {} that are separated by semi-colons (;}. A property is a \"name: value\" pair such as TextHeight: 12 pts. An element is any other expression, including variables and values returned from function calls. The properties and elements of a revision are computed at runtime, so a revision \"executes\" just like a scope in a function.\n A revision adds elements to, and modifies the properties of, format objects in a document. A revision acts on the format object to its left, without modifying it. The combination of the left-hand operand and the right-hand revision is a new revised object that has the properties and elements of the left-hand format/revision plus any additional elements of the right-hand revision, and the added (or overridden) properties of the right-hand revision. By stacking and combining revisions, hierarchical style dictionaries can be created easily in a manner that is similar to Cascading Style Sheets or to the way word processors allow styles to inherit from each other and override properties.\n The following code creates a empty Paragraph and revises it with content and properties. The placement of properties has no effect, but the placement of elements is always in order.\n Paragraph {1; 2; 3; \"abc\"; TextColor: Colors.Blue}; \n  ⇒ 123abc\n The following code creates a paragraph 'style' called Heading1 by revising the Paragraph format with several properties. It then uses the Heading1 style by revising it with a string element.\n Heading1 = Paragraph {TextColor: Colors.Green; TextWeight: Bold}; Heading1 {\"Chapter 1\"}; \n  ⇒ Chapter 1\n Revisions + arrays\n Special treatment is given to elements in a revision that are arrays. In this case, all of the elements of the array become elements of the revision, without changing the array. Combining this mechanism with the each operator, described above, allows for the succinct inclusion of iterated content.\n Paragraph { Square(each [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); Separator: \", \"; }; \n  ⇒ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25\n Revisions with if/else\n If statements can be used in a revision to programmatically include or exclude properties and elements from a revision based on a condition.\n ShowCount(count) = Paragraph { \"The count is \"; count; if (count > 10) \" and it's too big.\"; else TextColor: Colors.Green; }; ShowCount(5); ShowCount(20); \n  ⇒ The count is 5\n The count is 20 and it's too big.\n Revisions with loops\n for, foreach, do and while loop statements can be used in a revision to iteratively add elements.\n ShowNumbers(int count) = Paragraph { Separator: \", \"; for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) for (int j = 0; j < count; ++j) i * j; // This value gets added for each pass of the inner loop }; ShowNumbers(4); \n  ⇒ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 0, 3, 6, 9\n    submitted by    /u/Impressive-Gear-4334  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"programming","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ngwm1p/nytril_a_programming_language_and_a_markup/","createdUtc":1757895601.369,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ngwm1p/nytril_a_programming_language_and_a_markup/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601369,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":20,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":5,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":20}}}

I'm happy to say the Josh (Qix) the maintainer that was compromised agreed to sit down with me and discuss his experience, it was a very candid conversation but one I think was important to have.\n Below are some of the highlight and takeaways from the conversation, since the “how could this happen?” question is still circulating.\n Was MFA on the account?\n “There was definitely MFA… but timed one-time passwords are not phishing resistant. They can be man in the middle. There’s no cryptographic checks, no domain association, nothing like U2F would have.”\n The attackers used a fake NPM login flow and captured his TOTP, allowing them to fully impersonate him. Josh called out not enabling phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/U2F) as his biggest technical mistake.\n The scale of the blast radius\n Charlie (our researcher) spotted the issue while triaging suspicious packages:\n “First I saw the debug package… then I saw chalk and error-ex… and I knew a significant portion of the JS ecosystem would be impacted.”\n Wiz later reported that 99% of cloud environments used at least one affected package.\n “The fact it didn’t do anything was the bullet we dodged. It ran in CI/CD, on laptops, servers, enterprise machines. It could have done anything.”\n Wiz also reported that 10% of cloud environments they analyzed had the malware inside them. There were some 'hot takes' on the internet that, in fact this was not a big deal and some said it was a win for security. Josh shared that this was not a win and the only reason we got away with it was because how ineffective the attackers were. The malicious packages were downloaded 2.5 million times in the 2 hour window they were live.\n Ecosystem-level shortcomings\n Josh was frank about registry response times and missing safeguards:\n “There was a huge process breakdown during this attack with NPM. Extremely slow to respond. No preemptive ‘switch to U2F’ push despite billions of downloads. I had no recourse except filing a ticket through their public form.\"\n Josh also gave some advice for anyone going through this in the future which is to be open and transparent, the internet largely agreed Josh handled this in the best way possible (short of not getting phished in the first place )\n “If you screw up, own it. In open source, being transparent and immediate saves a lot of people’s time and money. Vulnerability (the human kind) goes a long way.”\n    submitted by    /u/Advocatemack  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"programming","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nf6df3/i_got_pwned_npm_maintainer_of_chalk_debug_speaks/","createdUtc":1757895601.369,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nf6df3/i_got_pwned_npm_maintainer_of_chalk_debug_speaks/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601369,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":50,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":30,"contextScore":5,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":50}}}

{"id":"1ngmy9q","title":"Struggling with strict tech limitations on an internal Project","body":"The project we’re working on in my current company is an internal tool, mainly administrative, to make work easier for other (non-programmer) employees.  \n  \nHere’s the problem: as the dev team responsible for this project, I don’t really have much say in deciding what technologies we can use.  \n  \nOur team lead has pretty much decided that we’re only allowed to use vanilla JS. No HTMX, no StimulusJS, no extras at all. On the backend, we’re using CodeIgniter 4.  \nThe argument against using HTMX, for example, is that it’s not widely used right now, and browsers might cause compatibility issues with it years from now!  \n  \nTo make things worse, all of our JavaScript has to be written in a single file. Import/export and proper separation of concerns are forbidden. The justification? \"Debugging is easier when everything is in one file.\"  \n  \nI honestly feel lost and worried this might cause the project to fail in the future.

{"id":"1ng88ei","title":"I made an open-sourced (and deployed), lightweight real-time Python IDE","body":"For the past 2 months, I’ve been working on a full-stack project I’m really proud of called **PyTogether;** a real-time collaborative Python IDE designed for new programmers (think Google Docs, but for Python). It’s meant for pair programming, tutoring, or just studying Python together.\n\nIt’s completely free. No subscriptions, no ads, nothing. Just create an account, make a group, and start a project. You can try it out or test it here:[ https://www.pytogether.org](https://www.pytogether.org).\n\n**Why build this when Replit or VS Code Live Share already exist?**  \nBecause my goal was **simplicity (and education)**. I wanted something lightweight for new programmers who just want to write and share simple Python scripts (alone or with others), without downloads, paywalls, or extra noise. There’s also no AI/copilot built in - something many teachers and learners actually prefer.\n\n**Tech stack (frontend):**\n\n* React + TailwindCSS\n* CodeMirror for linting\n* Y.js for real-time syncing\n* Skulpt to execute Python in the browser (for safety - I initially wanted Docker containers, but that would eat too much memory at scale. Skulpt has a limited library, so unfortunately imports like pygame wont work).\n\nI don’t enjoy frontend or UI design much, so I leaned on AI for some design help, but all the logic/code is mine. Deployed via Vercel.\n\n**Tech stack (backend):**\n\n* Django (channels, auth, celery/redis support made it a great fit)\n* PostgreSQL via Supabase\n* JWT + OAuth authentication\n* Redis for channel layers + caching\n* Fully Dockerized + deployed on a VPS (8GB RAM, $7/mo deal)\n\n**Data models:**  \nUsers <-> Groups -> Projects -> Code\n\n* Users can join many groups\n* Groups can have multiple projects\n* Each project belongs to one group and has one code file (kept simple for beginners, though I may add a file system later).\n\nThere were a lot of issues I came across when building this project, especially related to the backend. My biggest issue was figuring out how to create a reliable and smart autosave system. I couldn't just make it save on every user keystroke because for obvious reasons, that would overwhelm the database especially at scale. So I came up with a solution that I am really proud of; I used Redis to cache active projects, then used Celery to loop through these active projects every minute and then persist the code to the db. I did this by tracking a user count for each project everytime someone joins or leaves, and if the user count drops to 0 for a project, remove it from Redis (save the code too). Redis is extremely fast, so saving the code on every keystroke is not a problem at all. I am essentially hitting 4 birds with one stone with this because I am reusing Redis, which I've already integrated into my channel layers, to track active projects, and to also cache the code so when a new user enters the project, instead of hitting the db for the code, it'll get it from Redis. I even get to use Redis as my message broker for Celery (didn't use RabbitMQ because I wanted to conserve storage instead of dockerizing an entirely new service). This would also work really well at scale since Celery would offload the task of autosaving a lot of code away from the backend. The code also saves when someone leaves the project. Another issue I came across later is if people try sending a huge load of text, so I just capped the limit to 1 MB (will tinker with this).\n\nDeployment on a VPS was another beast. I spent \\~8 hours wrangling Nginx, Certbot, Docker, and GitHub Actions to get everything up and running. It was frustrating, but I learned a lot.\n\nHonestly, I learned more from this one project than from dozens of smaller toy projects. It forced me to dive into real-world problems like caching, autosaving, scaling, and deployment.

{"id":"1neyy1m","title":"Software development is changing AGAIN","body":"Here’s why: \n\nFrom the 1940s to 1950s: Programs were written in machine code and assembly language (Binaries), basically ones and zeros. You had to handle the hardware. \n\nFrom 1960s to 1970s: High-level languages (COBOL, FORTRAN, C) and more human-readable code were introduced.\n\nBy 1980s: We had personal computers and more programming languages making development easier (C++, Smalltalk). More reusable codes and graphic user interfaces were introduced. \n\nBy the 1990s: Internet started. Things like client-server apps, Java, other languages (PHP, JavaScript, Python) were entering the scene making development easier compared to the 1950s\n\nBy the 2000s: Web 2.0 (interactive apps), open-source boom, SaaS model started gaining popularity. \n\nThen, by the 2010s: Cloud computing, mobile apps, APIs, and DevOps, enabling fast, scalable software delivery.\n\nFrom the 2020s to NOW: AI-assisted development, low-code/no-code platforms, automation, agentic AI systems. The focus is shifting from writing code to connecting tools and solving problems.\n\nMy point is, with the advancement in tech, we see software development becoming more automated since the 1950s. Having the coding knowledge is great and will help you a lot. However, don’t get caught up trying to manually write up all codes like you used to before 2023. Soon, the industry will start using only AI to write the code and more will be required from you as a developer. You will become the software architect. \n\nJust a realisation I had today.

Each tool demands its own format - `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`. Keeping coding standards consistent across all these tools is frustrating and error-prone.\n\n## The Solution\n\nAI-Rulez lets you write your project configuration once and automatically generates native files for every AI tool - current and future ones. It's like having a build system for AI context.\n\n## Why This Matters for TypeScript Teams\n\nDevelopment teams face common challenges:\n\n- **Multiple tools, multiple configs**: Your team uses Claude Code for reviews, Cursor for development, Copilot for completions\n- **TypeScript-specific standards**: Type safety, testing patterns, dependency management\n- **Monorepo complexity**: Multiple services and packages all need different AI contexts  \n- **Team consistency**: Junior devs get different AI guidance than seniors\n\nAI-Rulez solves this with a single `ai-rulez.yaml` that understands your project's conventions.\n\n## AI-Powered Multi-Agent Configuration Generation\n\nThe `init` command is where AI-Rulez shines. Instead of manually writing configurations, **multiple specialized AI agents analyze your codebase** and collaborate to generate comprehensive instructions:\n\n```bash\n# Multiple AI agents analyze your codebase and generate rich config\nnpx ai-rulez init \"My TypeScript Project\" --preset popular --use-agent claude --yes\n```\n\nThis automatically:\n\n- **Codebase Analysis Agent**: Detects your tech stack (React/Vue/Angular, testing frameworks, build tools)\n- **Patterns Agent**: Identifies project conventions and architectural patterns\n- **Standards Agent**: Generates appropriate coding standards and best practices\n- **Specialization Agent**: Creates domain-specific agents for different tasks (code review, testing, documentation)\n- **Security Agent**: Automatically adds all generated AI files to `.gitignore`\n\nThe result is extensive, rich AI assistant instructions tailored specifically to your TypeScript project.\n\n## Universal Output Generation\n\nOne YAML config generates files for every tool:\n\n```yaml\n# ai-rulez.yaml\nmetadata:\n  name: \"TypeScript API Service\"\n\npresets:\n  - \"popular\"  # Auto-configures Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Gemini\n\nrules:\n  - name: \"TypeScript Standards\"\n    priority: critical\n    content: |\n      - Strict TypeScript 5.0+ with noImplicitAny\n      -

Do NOT use v2 classes, especially bg-opacity-20.\" But, the AI keeps giving me `bg-opacity-20` anyway.

We’ll start with a small MVP:\n\n* Collect user info,\n* Store it in a database,\n* Include basic authentication.\n\nI've been debating with the right stack - especially for the frontend.\n\nI love the DX of frameworks like Next.js, React Router, Solid, Svelte, and Astro. But they all ship extra JavaScript that users don’t need. For a little-to-no-interactive small app, that feels like overkill.\n\n(I love the snapiness of a mimialminimal JS-free site!) \n\nI’m debating:\n\n* **Qwik**: It's a framework. But, minimal JS is shipped to the browser. I'm unsure if it’s easy for new teammates to pick up or it becomes too niche (Remember we're in a B2B setting and long term support matters)\n* **HTMX**: I like it a lot, but then my head starts spinning with the details:\n   * **Minification** – What tool should I use? Vite/Rollup expect a single entry file, but I’d need something that handles JS per path. Gulp could work, but that means writing my own build pipeline.\n   * **Components** – Frameworks like React/Svelte make components simple and give me SSR. With Web Components (even with Lit), I run into issues like Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC). There are SSR options for Web Components, but I haven’t tried them yet.\n   * **Critical CSS** – I’d like to extract and inline important CSS for faster loads.\n\n\n\nI once tried Go + HTMX, but I went back to Remix because:\n\n* components in HTMX felt too verbose,\n* I had to manage a full build system,\n* orchestrating JS file loads was painful.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’d love to “go back to the platform” (just HTML + JS), but all the old problems come back.\n\n\n\nI’m sure I’m missing something.

Wouldn't even call myself a real experienced developer, just someone who learned enough to ship products. But even I had to unlearn a bunch of habits when I started using AI tools.\n\nThe biggest one was accepting that I don't need to understand every line of code anymore. I love coding and actually enjoyed writing everything from scratch, learning how each piece worked. But when you're trying to ship MVPs while working a day job, using AI just makes more sense financially (as much as it hurts my ego lol).\n\nI still think real coding knowledge is irreplaceable though. The AI generates code but you need to know what to ask for and whether the output makes sense. I've seen people with zero coding experience try to build with these tools and fail immediatley.\n\nMy stack now is Cursor/Claude Code for writing code (recently been trying out Codex too), Chatgpt/Claude for planning mvps, Claude when I need to understand something complex, coderabbit for finding issues in PRs and v0 for quick UI components. I use Perplexity (which I got for free) too depending on what I'm building. It's definitely faster than my old workflow.\n\nThe hardest part was letting go of the craftsman mentality. I used to take pride in wiritng clean code myself. Now I ship \"good enough\" code that works, even if I didn't write most of it.\n\nI still feel like something is lost in the process.

(this is my first proper full stack project btw so forgive me if anything breaks 😭)\n\n**some features:**\n\n* **scanning recents**: clanker looks through and roasts your recent played music, while processing the rest of the data in the background.\n* **interactive q&a**: 6 multiple-choice questions based on your own data \n* **final roast**: metrics like variety score, basicness index, listening patterns and a paragraph like verdict to make you question your existence.\n* **neighbor search**: weighted jaccard algorithm compares your top artists, tracks, and genres to other users\n* **dashboard:** terminal-style dashboard with your top artists, tracks, and genres, and links to neighbors and roast pages.\n* a light and dark mode toggle and fully responsive design\n\n**tech stack:**\n\n* next.js with nextauth for frontend/backend\n* spotify & gemini/openai api's for the data and ai roast\n* tailwind and framer-motion for styling & animations\n* supabase for database & deployed on vercel\n\ni'd love any and every feedback on the experience, the ui, and any problems (and also whether the roast feels personal enough). i'm especially curious how it runs for people with more mainstream vs niche listening habits.

Which would you pick for a client app (no SEO concern)?\n\nLooking forward to your input!","author":"RUNE_KING--","score":7,"numComments":3,"subreddit":"webdev","permalink":"/r/webdev/comments/1ngi779/blazor_vs_sveltekit_for_frontend_with_net_backend/","createdUtc":1757825329,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ngi779/blazor_vs_sveltekit_for_frontend_with_net_backend/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895613001,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1ng8rb9","title":"We spent 33 months building a data grid, here's how we solved slow UIs.","body":"A few months ago, we launched the beta of [LyteNyte Grid](https://www.1771technologies.com/), our high-performance React data grid. Today, we're taking the next leap forward with LyteNyte Grid v1, a major release that reflects months of feedback, iteration, and performance tuning.\n\n# Headless By Design\n\nLyteNyte Grid is now fully headless. We’ve broken the grid down into composable React components, giving you total control over structure, behavior, and styling. There’s no black-box component logic. You decide what the grid looks like, how it behaves, and how it integrates with your stack.\n\n* Works with any styling system. Tailwind, CSS Modules, Emotion, you name it.\n* Attach event listeners and refs without the gymnastics.\n* Fully declarative views and state. No magic, just React.\n\nIf you don’t feel like going through all the styling work, we also have pre-made themes that are a single class name to apply.\n\n# Halved the Bundle Size\n\nWe’ve slashed our bundle size by about 50% across both Core and PRO editions.\n\n* **Core** can be as small as 36kb (including sorting, filtering, virtualization, column/row actions, and much more).\n* **PRO** can be as small as 49kb and adds advanced features like column pivoting, tree data, and server-side data.\n\n# Even Faster Performance\n\nLyteNyte Grid has always been fast. It’s now faster. We’ve optimized core rendering, refined internal caching, and improved interaction latency even under load. LyteNyte can handle 10,000 updates a second even faster now.\n\n# Other Improvements\n\n* Improved TypeScript support. Since the beginning we’ve had great TypeScript support. LyteNyte Grid v1 just makes this better.\n* Improve API interfaces and simplified function calls.\n* Cleaner package exports and enhanced tree shaking capabilities.\n\nIf you need a free, open-source data grid for your React project, try out LyteNyte Grid. It’s zero cost and open source under Apache 2.0. If you like what we’re building, GitHub stars help and feature suggestions or improvements are always welcome.\n\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/1771-Technologies/lytenyte)\n* [Live Demo](https://www.1771technologies.com/demo)","author":"After_Medicine8859","score":546,"numComments":50,"subreddit":"webdev","permalink":"/r/webdev/comments/1ng8rb9/we_spent_33_months_building_a_data_grid_heres_how/","createdUtc":1757797540,"url":"https://i.redd.it/b1ormh4pxzof1.png","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895613001,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

Just taking some time, is all.\n\n# How It Works\n\n*Th following is taken from the readme:*\n\nThe CSS layer structure ensures proper precedence:\n\n* **theme**: Tailwind's CSS custom properties and design tokens\n* **lk-base**: LiftKit's core styles and Tailwind's preflight/reset\n* **components**: Component-specific styles\n* **utilities**: Utility classes (highest precedence)\n\nThis setup allows you to use both standard Tailwind utilities and LiftKit's golden ratio utilities together:\n\n    <div class=\"mt-md bg-primary text-onprimary\"> Liftkit </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"mt-4 bg-amber-900 text-black\"> Tailwind v4 </div>\n\nThe utilities layer has the highest precedence, allowing Tailwind utilities to override LiftKit base styles when needed, while still preserving LiftKit's golden ratio system and Material 3 colors.\n\n# FAQ's\n\n* **Why no official support?**\n   * We don't have the manpower... yet. Chainlift's core team still consists entirely of part-timers, including the founder/owner (me). However, we encourage contributors to communicate with us so we can add you to our Slack and offer guidance.\n* **What the hell is LiftKit?**\n   * It's an open-source design system that automatically applies high-level design details like golden ratio scaling, optical symmetry, etc, by giving you simple utility classes that handle all that logic for you.\n* **There's no such thing as \"perfect\" design.**\n   * Facts. The intent behind LiftKit is to simply give you shorthand classes for the nuanced things usually only expert designers can do (like optical symmetry) or stuff that's usually too big a pain to bother attempting (like golden ratio proportions).\n* **Why just Next.js?**\n   * That's not forever. It's just the only framework I knew when I created it. We're actively working on SvelteKit. If anyone wants to help us with other frameworks, please DM me.\n\n# Other Links\n\n\\- [LiftKit official repo](https://github.com/Chainlift/liftkit)\n\n\\- [LiftKit Overview (website)](https://www.chainlift.io/liftkit)\n\nI'll respond to as many questions as I can today, but might be a little delayed.\n\nOh, and we're going to update the docs soon. Just need to migrate it out of Webflow and pick a documentation framework. Don't ask what made me think Webflow was a good choice for tech docs, because I don't know either.","author":"chainlift","score":18,"numComments":3,"subreddit":"webdev","permalink":"/r/webdev/comments/1ng4cfi/thanks_to_this_subreddit_my_oddlysatisfying/","createdUtc":1757786685,"url":"https://i.redd.it/tkftajn50zof1.jpeg","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895613001,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1nfvu4v","title":"I built OpenMapEditor, a privacy-first map editor with Vanilla JS & Leaflet. It processes GPX/KML files entirely in your browser.","body":"Hi r/webdev,\n\nFor Showoff Saturday, I'm sharing OpenMapEditor. I'm a heavy user of apps like Organic Maps and wanted a desktop tool to manage my geographic data (GPX, KML/KMZ files) without uploading my files to a third-party service. So, I built one.\n\nThe main goal was privacy and power, which meant making it run 100% on the client-side.\n\n**Live Demo:** [https://www.openmapeditor.com/](https://www.openmapeditor.com/)\n\n**GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/openmapeditor/openmapeditor](https://github.com/openmapeditor/openmapeditor)\n\n**Tech Highlights:**\n\n* **Full Organic Maps Compatibility:** It's designed for perfect KMZ backup compatibility. It correctly parses and preserves all 16 of the specific Organic Maps colors for paths and markers on import and writes them back correctly on export. All this KML/KMZ parsing and generation happens entirely in the browser using libraries like `JSZip` and `togeojson`. Your data never touches a server.\n* **Zero Build Step:** The entire app is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, using Leaflet.js as the core mapping library. There's no npm, no bundler, and no transpiling. It was a fun challenge in keeping the architecture simple.\n* **Multiple Elevation Providers:** You can generate elevation profiles for any path. It's configurable in the settings to pull data from different sources, including Google's Elevation API and the public Open Topo Data API.\n* **Performance Optimized:** To keep the UI smooth with huge GPS tracks from services like Strava, it automatically simplifies complex paths on import using `simplify-js`. This is on by default but can be disabled in the settings if you need full precision.\n* **It's a PWA:** You can \"install\" it to your desktop for a more app-like experience via the link in the map's attribution notice.\n\nThe project also integrates with the Strava API, has a custom routing panel that works with Mapbox and OSRM, and features a fully custom layer controller.\n\nThe code is on GitHub and I'd love to get your feedback, especially on the \"no build step\" approach or any performance ideas you might have.\n\nThanks for checking it out!","author":"arar7000","score":96,"numComments":3,"subreddit":"webdev","permalink":"/r/webdev/comments/1nfvu4v/i_built_openmapeditor_a_privacyfirst_map_editor/","createdUtc":1757765267,"url":"https://i.redd.it/eovgpmhhaxof1.png","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895613001,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1nfvb6o","title":"Visual editor for easily building and customizing Tailwind UIs","body":"TL;DR: [https://windframe.dev](https://windframe.dev/)\n\nTailwind has become a favorite for styling UIs because it lets developers build clean, polished interfaces quickly and consistently. It removes the hassle of managing separate CSS files while still letting you fine-tune every detail. But building clean UIs can still feel tricky if design isn’t your strength or you’re still not fully familiar with most of the Tailwind classes. I've been building Windframe to help with this. It's a tool that combines AI with a visual editor to make this process even more easier and fast.\n\nWith AI, you can generate polished UIs in seconds with solid typography, balanced spacing, and clean styling already set up. From there, the visual editor lets you tweak layouts, colors, or text directly without worrying about the right classes. And if you just need a small adjustment, you can make it instantly without regenerating the whole design.\n\nHere’s the workflow:  \n✅ Generate complete UIs with AI, already styled with clean typography, spacing, and polished defaults  \n✅ Or start from 1000+ pre-made templates for a quick base  \n✅ Visually tweak layouts, colors, and text with no class hunting  \n✅ Make small edits instantly without re-prompting the entire design  \n✅ Export everything directly into React, Vue, Svelte, or HTML project\n\nThis makes it easy to build clean and beautiful UIs with Tailwind that look polished from the start without all the extra effort.\n\nThis workflow makes it really easy to consistently build clean and beautiful UIs with React + Tailwind\n\nHere is a link to the tool: [https://windframe.dev](https://windframe.dev)\n\nAnd here’s the template from the demo above if you want to remix or play with it: *Demo template*: [Demo template](https://windframe.devwares.com/editor?p=DRONpVVxuPPIf7IVUQJ8)\n\nAs always, feedback and suggestions are highly welcome!","author":"Speedware01","score":61,"numComments":17,"subreddit":"webdev","permalink":"/r/webdev/comments/1nfvb6o/visual_editor_for_easily_building_and_customizing/","createdUtc":1757763574,"url":"https://i.redd.it/0h87n1tj0xof1.gif","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895613001,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

It basically adds a 20s delay before you enter sites you have deemed as 'time-wasters', and even provides you with nudges for good things to do instead. This extra friction gives you the opportunity to take control of the impulsive action - and i have honestly found it surprisingly helpful.\n\nThis is my first browser extension, but it won't be my last. For those who dont know, browser extensions are just .html, .css and .js along with a manifest, which makes it super intuitive and easy for web developers. It's been difficult figuring out how to manage a multi-platform extension from a single codebase, since it is my goal to have it available on all browsers. The browser-polyfil has made this much easier, but i have had to make a pretty beefy build script anyway for this to work.\n\nSo if you also have sites you are tired of impulsively browsing, then please give it a go and let my know what you think.

We are members of the W3C Web Developer Experience Community Group (WebDX CG) and we'll be hosting an AMA right here on Thursday, September 18th, starting at 9:00 AM ET. We're all about making your life as a web developer easier, and we're here to chat about our projects like Baseline, and answer all your burning questions.\n What is the WebDX CG?\n Our mission is to improve your experience developing for the Web platform, through two main pillars:\n  \nCoordinating research to get a clear, data-driven picture of the major obstacles and gaps that developers face every day.\n Building a shared understanding of the interoperable parts of the web platform to promote clear, consistent communication about which features developers can use confidently.\n  \nWe are a group of browser vendors, developers, and other web stakeholders dedicated to identifying and smoothing out the sharp edges of web development.\n What do we actually work on?\n You may already be familiar with some of our work, including \n  \nBaseline: Baseline provides clear information about which web platform features are compatible across a core set of browsers. It gives developers confidence in the level of browser compatibility when reading articles or choosing libraries for their projects. By aligning with Baseline, developers can expect fewer surprises when testing their sites.\n Supporting Interoperability: Our work directly supports browser interoperability. By defining clear feature sets (like Baseline), we create a shared target for browser vendors and reduce the inconsistencies that cause developer frustration.

It’s a great solution for straightforward CRUD applications. That said, in most cases I still would find myself implementing core domain abstractions to ensure that the data remains valid and consistent.\n Once I’m doing that, I also want to avoid locking myself into a specific solution for authorization. In that scenario, I’d probably just go with a managed Postgres instance (so I know it runs smoothly) and host my own application stack (potentially with Kubernetes and a dedicated authZ solution like Keycloak or Ory Kratos).\n I’ll admit that features like RLS are quite nice.

Today, we're taking the next leap forward with LyteNyte Grid v1, a major release that reflects months of feedback, iteration, and performance tuning.\n Headless By Design\n LyteNyte Grid is now fully headless. We’ve broken the grid down into composable React components, giving you total control over structure, behavior, and styling. There’s no black-box component logic. You decide what the grid looks like, how it behaves, and how it integrates with your stack.\n  \nWorks with any styling system. Tailwind, CSS Modules, Emotion, you name it.\n Attach event listeners and refs without the gymnastics.\n Fully declarative views and state. No magic, just React.\n  \nIf you don’t feel like going through all the styling work, we also have pre-made themes that are a single class name to apply.\n Halved the Bundle Size\n We’ve slashed our bundle size by about 50% across both Core and PRO editions.\n  \nCore can be as small as 36kb (including sorting, filtering, virtualization, column/row actions, and much more).\n PRO can be as small as 49kb and adds advanced features like column pivoting, tree data, and server-side data.\n  \nEven Faster Performance\n LyteNyte Grid has always been fast. It’s now faster. We’ve optimized core rendering, refined internal caching, and improved interaction latency even under load. LyteNyte can handle 10,000 updates a second even faster now.\n Other Improvements\n  \nImproved TypeScript support. Since the beginning we’ve had great TypeScript support. LyteNyte Grid v1 just makes this better.\n Improve API interfaces and simplified function calls.\n Cleaner package exports and enhanced tree shaking capabilities.\n  \nIf you need a free, open-source data grid for your React project, try out LyteNyte Grid. It’s zero cost and open source under Apache 2.0. If you like what we’re building, GitHub stars help and feature suggestions or improvements are always welcome.\n  \nGitHub\n Live Demo\n  \n   submitted by    /u/After_Medicine8859  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"webdev","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ng8rb9/we_spent_33_months_building_a_data_grid_heres_how/","createdUtc":1757895601.617,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1ng8rb9/we_spent_33_months_building_a_data_grid_heres_how/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601617,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":35,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":15,"contextScore":5,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":35}}}

No HTMX, no StimulusJS, no extras at all. On the backend, we’re using CodeIgniter 4.\n The argument against using HTMX, for example, is that it’s not widely used right now, and browsers might cause compatibility issues with it years from now! \n To make things worse, all of our JavaScript has to be written in a single file. Import/export and proper separation of concerns are forbidden. The justification? \"Debugging is easier when everything is in one file.\" \n I honestly feel lost and worried this might cause the project to fail in the future. Since I joined, I’ve been working hard to improve my JS skills, learning from multiple sources, and I still am. But I feel like we’re more of a backend-focused team, and being forced into plain JS in a single file isn’t going to be easy. \n One idea I had was to at least structure the single JS file with classes, one class per backend view, each with its own methods. \n What do you think?

It processes GPX/KML files entirely in your browser.","body":"Hi r/webdev,\n For Showoff Saturday, I'm sharing OpenMapEditor. I'm a heavy user of apps like Organic Maps and wanted a desktop tool to manage my geographic data (GPX, KML/KMZ files) without uploading my files to a third-party service. So, I built one.\n The main goal was privacy and power, which meant making it run 100% on the client-side.\n Live Demo: https://www.openmapeditor.com/\n GitHub Repo: https://github.com/openmapeditor/openmapeditor\n Tech Highlights:\n  \nFull Organic Maps Compatibility: It's designed for perfect KMZ backup compatibility. It correctly parses and preserves all 16 of the specific Organic Maps colors for paths and markers on import and writes them back correctly on export. All this KML/KMZ parsing and generation happens entirely in the browser using libraries like JSZip and togeojson. Your data never touches a server.\n Zero Build Step: The entire app is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, using Leaflet.js as the core mapping library. There's no npm, no bundler, and no transpiling. It was a fun challenge in keeping the architecture simple.\n Multiple Elevation Providers: You can generate elevation profiles for any path. It's configurable in the settings to pull data from different sources, including Google's Elevation API and the public Open Topo Data API.\n Performance Optimized: To keep the UI smooth with huge GPS tracks from services like Strava, it automatically simplifies complex paths on import using simplify-js. This is on by default but can be disabled in the settings if you need full precision.\n It's a PWA: You can \"install\" it to your desktop for a more app-like experience via the link in the map's attribution notice.\n  \nThe project also integrates with the Strava API, has a custom routing panel that works with Mapbox and OSRM, and features a fully custom layer controller.\n The code is on GitHub and I'd love to get your feedback, especially on the \"no build step\" approach or any performance ideas you might have.\n Thanks for checking it out!\n    submitted by    /u/arar7000  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"webdev","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nfvu4v/i_built_openmapeditor_a_privacyfirst_map_editor/","createdUtc":1757895601.617,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nfvu4v/i_built_openmapeditor_a_privacyfirst_map_editor/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601617,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":50,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":30,"contextScore":5,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":50}}}

The majority of requests involved expanding support beyond just Next.js, and a few people reached out to help. Thanks to you, Chainlift's a proper team now! And this week we've made our first big step towards broader support.\n You can now use LiftKit's golden scaling system with Tailwind thanks to jellydeck on GitHub.\n Please keep in mind:\n  \nThis is the very first release, early early access, so there may be bugs.\n Not officially supported by Chainlift at this time. For support or questions, please raise issues or contact the repo owner.\n  \nWhat this repo does\n  \nWorks with Next.js + Tailwind\n Lets you use LiftKit components\n Still install from registry via CLI\n Uses CSS layering to apply LiftKit by default, but you can override with Tailwind\n  \nTo be clear, we are actively developing support beyond Next.js. Just taking some time, is all.\n How It Works\n Th following is taken from the readme:\n The CSS layer structure ensures proper precedence:\n  \ntheme: Tailwind's CSS custom properties and design tokens\n lk-base: LiftKit's core styles and Tailwind's preflight/reset\n components: Component-specific styles\n utilities: Utility classes (highest precedence)\n  \nThis setup allows you to use both standard Tailwind utilities and LiftKit's golden ratio utilities together:\n <div class=\"mt-md bg-primary text-onprimary\"> Liftkit </div> <div class=\"mt-4 bg-amber-900 text-black\"> Tailwind v4 </div> \n The utilities layer has the highest precedence, allowing Tailwind utilities to override LiftKit base styles when needed, while still preserving LiftKit's golden ratio system and Material 3 colors.\n FAQ's\n  \nWhy no official support? \n We don't have the manpower... yet. Chainlift's core team still consists entirely of part-timers, including the founder/owner (me). However, we encourage contributors to communicate with us so we can add you to our Slack and offer guidance.\n \n What the hell is LiftKit? \n It's an open-source design system that automatically applies high-level design details like golden ratio scaling, optical symmetry, etc, by giving you simple utility classes that handle all that logic for you.\n \n There's no such thing as \"perfect\" design. \n Facts. The intent behind LiftKit is to simply give you shorthand classes for the nuanced things usually only expert designers can do (like optical symmetry) or stuff that's usually too big a pain to bother attempting (like golden ratio proportions).\n \n Why just Next.js? \n That's not forever. It's just the only framework I knew when I created it. We're actively working on SvelteKit. If anyone wants to help us with other frameworks, please DM me.\n \n  \nOther Links\n - LiftKit official repo\n - LiftKit Overview (website)\n I'll respond to as many questions as I can today, but might be a little delayed.\n Oh, and we're going to update the docs soon. Just need to migrate it out of Webflow and pick a documentation framework.

{"id":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nfvb6o/visual_editor_for_easily_building_and_customizing/","title":"Visual editor for easily building and customizing Tailwind UIs","body":"TL;DR: https://windframe.dev\n Tailwind has become a favorite for styling UIs because it lets developers build clean, polished interfaces quickly and consistently. It removes the hassle of managing separate CSS files while still letting you fine-tune every detail. But building clean UIs can still feel tricky if design isn’t your strength or you’re still not fully familiar with most of the Tailwind classes. I've been building Windframe to help with this. It's a tool that combines AI with a visual editor to make this process even more easier and fast.\n With AI, you can generate polished UIs in seconds with solid typography, balanced spacing, and clean styling already set up. From there, the visual editor lets you tweak layouts, colors, or text directly without worrying about the right classes. And if you just need a small adjustment, you can make it instantly without regenerating the whole design.\n Here’s the workflow:\n ✅ Generate complete UIs with AI, already styled with clean typography, spacing, and polished defaults\n ✅ Or start from 1000+ pre-made templates for a quick base\n ✅ Visually tweak layouts, colors, and text with no class hunting\n ✅ Make small edits instantly without re-prompting the entire design\n ✅ Export everything directly into React, Vue, Svelte, or HTML project\n This makes it easy to build clean and beautiful UIs with Tailwind that look polished from the start without all the extra effort.\n This workflow makes it really easy to consistently build clean and beautiful UIs with React + Tailwind\n Here is a link to the tool: https://windframe.dev\n And here’s the template from the demo above if you want to remix or play with it: Demo template: Demo template\n As always, feedback and suggestions are highly welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/Speedware01  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"webdev","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nfvb6o/visual_editor_for_easily_building_and_customizing/","createdUtc":1757895601.617,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1nfvb6o/visual_editor_for_easily_building_and_customizing/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601617,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":20,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":5,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":20}}}

I’m naturally motivated by tangible results, which is why I love coding I can see what I create. But when it comes to other subjects, or even “harder” coding problems, the process itself feels painful.\n\nEven when I break tasks into small problems, if I can’t solve them immediately, my mood collapses. I find it hard to enjoy learning for the sake of learning or the process itself. Most of my motivation is tied to performance and results, I want to change that. I love coding, but lately it feels like I’m running purely on willpower, not actual enjoyment, and it isn’t as satisfying as it used to be.\n\nThis year in school doesn’t help. I have exams in literature, history, and math, which make it hard to focus on coding. I’ve even stopped working on projects because the thought “I must prepare for the exams” hits me like a train and ruins my mood. I absolutely despise literature, and the teacher isn’t making it any easier. On top of that, because of the Ukrainian war, I was forced to move and now need to catch up on multiple subjects because i switched school systems (I never studied Hungarian literature or history so I had start from scratch) and I don’t have a choice I can’t go to university if I don’t pass but the pressure is overwhelming. I'm not particularly good at math and my programming teacher university is 50/50 coding and math and if we are not comfortable with it we better get comfortable asap and I'm scared of math and I'm general school is pushing us hard and I feel overwhelmed. I've been looking for a tutor and asked my parents... Hopefully I can find one soon\nRecently, I had a math test and what devasted me the most is when the teacher put a \"logic\" question I couldn't solve it which is \"supposed to be easy\" which is interesting because it's very similar what I do when the programming teacher gives us a takes to solve, ex: check if this list contains a perfect square\", I started learning math from grade 1 on Khan academy, completely restarting because my foundation is terrible but Its not really enough. The rise of AI shakes my confidence in IT, hearing it might replace coders is making me anxious, if I really picked a good \"future proof\" career, which then makes me think, \"just study AI development\" -> a bunch of others join AI development -> market oversaturated and competition will be high to find a job in the future.\n\nI might be spiraling \n\nMy question: How do you train yourself to enjoy the process of studying, not just the end result? Are there strategies, routines, or mindset shifts that make sitting down and learning inherently satisfying, even when the material isn’t naturally interesting and what would you do in my situation to \"get things in order\" I feel lost \n\nI really want to rewire how I approach studying and actually enjoy the process of creating and learning again.","author":{"name":"BitBat16"},"score":8,"numComments":5,"subreddit":{"display_name":"learnprogramming"},"permalink":"/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nh24jb/how_can_actually_enjoy_studying_instead_of/","createdUtc":1757882105,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nh24jb/how_can_actually_enjoy_studying_instead_of/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895614583,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

By effective I mean (ignoring UX for now):\n\n1. Solves the user’s problem in a near-optimal way performance-wise (bottlenecks could be DB queries, language choice, or old code not updated for stricter requirements).\n2. Isn’t overly complex: logic is intuitive, code easy to understand/maintain, minimal moving parts.\n3. Cost/time effective: I almost always underestimate how long production-ready work takes, and the startup urgency makes this stressful.\n\nContext: I’m a junior SWE at a small but successful startup (\\~10k customers, $1M+ revenue), no mentors, CS degree. I’ve shipped revenue-generating software at this company, but it feels sluggish and poorly architected cause simple changes take too long and my users aren't happy. This gets especially tough when there's older code not written by me which looks like it was written just to get things working with no regard for quality.\n\nQuestions I struggle with repeatedly:\n\n1. How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.\n2. How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.\n3. How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.\n4. How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?\n5. Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?\n6. Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?\n\n**I rely on AI** a lot for these questions and I worry I’m making uninformed choices that will become bad habits when I work with better, more experienced engineers. Is there some sort of tutorial / video that goes through this (Couldn't find the resources for this honestly).

{"id":"1nf2cik","title":"Anyone good at problem solving ? I need to synchronise my e-commerce stock with my suppliers","body":"First, let me apologize because I am not a developer, just a girl starting her e-commerce and who has to learn how to develop on the job.\n\n\n\nContext: my e-commerce sells about 600 unique products. Not like tee shirts, but each product is 100% unique, juste like an artwork with a serial number. My supplier has 10000s of unique products like that and has a very fast turnover of its own stock, so I have to constantly make sure that the stock that is on my website isn’t obsolete, and synchronized and everything available.\n\n  \nAt first, I thought, « Ok, I’ll just create a webpage with all the suppliers products links that I am using, then process the page with a link checker app and every broken link means the product has been sold ». \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn’t work because whenever my supplier sell a product, the page isn’t deleted but instead becomes blank.\n\n\n\nSo, I thought about using a crawling software which could detect the if there was a « add to cart » in the html or not. I did not work neither, cause their page is in JS and the html is blank, wether the product was available or not (I don’t know if that makes sense, sorry again I am just a novice)\n\n\n\nSo in the end I decided to code a small script in python which basically looks like that:\n\n\n\n1. I copy paste all the urls in my python file\n2. The bot goes to my supplier website and logs in with my IDs\n3. The bot opens every URL I copy pasted, and verifies if the button « add to cart » is available\n4. The bot answers me with « available » or « not available » for every link \n\n\n\nThe steps 3 and 4 looks like that (and yes I am French so sorry if some is written in it):\n\n\n\n\\# Ouvrir chaque URL dans un nouvel onglet\n\nfor url in urls:\n\nprint(f\"→ Vérification : {url}\")\n\nnew\\_page = await context.new\\_page()\n\ntry:\n\nawait new\\_page.goto(url, timeout=60000)\n\nawait new\\_page.wait\\_for\\_load\\_state(\"networkidle\", timeout=60000)\n\n\n\n\\# Vérifier si le bouton existe\n\nawait new\\_page.wait\\_for\\_selector('button:has-text(\"Add to Cart\")', timeout=10000)\n\nprint(f\"✅ DISPONIBLE : {url}\\\\n\")\n\n\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n\nprint(f\"❌ INDISPONIBLE : {url}\\\\n→ Erreur : {e}\\\\n\")\n\nfinally:\n\nawait new\\_page.close()\n\n\n\nawait browser.close()\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, while it seems like a good idea there are major issues with this option. The main one being that my supplier’s website isn’t 100% reliable in a sense that for some of the product pages, I have to refresh them multiples times until their appear (which the bot can’t do), or they take forever to load (about 10sec).\n\n\n\nSo right now my bot is taking FOREVER for checking each link (about 30sec/1min), but if I change the timeout then nothing works because my supplier’s website doesn’t even have time to react. Also, the way that my python bot is giving me the results « available » or « not available » is not practical at all, within in a full sentence, and it’s completely unmanageable for 600 products.\n\n\n\nI must precise that my supplier also has an app, and contrary to the website this app is working perfectly, zero delay, very smooth, but I have seriously no idea how to use the app’s data instead of the website ones, if that make sense.\n\n\n\nAnd I also thought about simply adding to favorites every product I add to my website so I’ll be notified whenever one sells out, but I cannot add 600 favorites and it seems like I don’t actually receive an email for each product sold on my supplier’s end.\n\n\n\nI am really lost on how to manage and solve this issue. This is definitely not my field of expertise and at this point I am looking for any advice, any out of the box idea, anything that could help me.\n\n\n\nThanks so much !\n\n","author":{"name":"LostWanderlust"},"score":1,"numComments":0,"subreddit":{"display_name":"learnprogramming"},"permalink":"/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nf2cik/anyone_good_at_problem_solving_i_need_to/","createdUtc":1757681356,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nf2cik/anyone_good_at_problem_solving_i_need_to/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895614583,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1neibf3","title":"How could one learn hands-on System Design and DevOps?","body":"So, I'm a bit of a beginner and I'm maybe still unsure of where System Design ends and DevOps begins, but one common thread that I've heard among people who prepare for FAANG interviews is that they learn Sytems Design concepts.\n\nNow, I've seen [these](https://youtu.be/j8yrVBwdSrY) sorts of videos, and well... to each their own, but I get this sort of feeling that the people who prepare for interviews from these playlists count on using rote memorization in order to ace their interviews. \n\nNow, as I said before, I have no problem with how others like to learn, but, personally, I'd like to see if there is a more hands-on approach to learning these concepts.\n\nFor example, here are some things I might like to know:\n\n- knowing what you know now, would you spend a few hundred dollars a month, BEFORE scoring your first job / internship on the introductory tiers on something like AWS or other providers of cloud services?\n- do self-hosted services even compare (for the purposes of a learning beginner, not production)? e.g. on a home server / NAS setup or on a docker container on your normal PC for day-to-day use\n- let's say I want to know how a Load Balancer works. Where / how could I write one from scratch? Could I deploy one in a self-hosted manner or do I need a cloud services provider? Obviously, I'm not talking about writing a Load Balancer as good as Cloudflare's, but simply about building a toy, non-scalable example to grasp the concepts. (As an analogy, imagine you want to learn Machine Learning. You first want to try writing your own multilayer perceptron, only to then later call functions from TensorFlow, scikit learn, Keras, etc.)\n\nApologies in advance if maybe all this sounds a bit idealistic.

{"id":"1nef7i8","title":"Decided to do a program \"school\" called 42, and now I'm way over my head.","body":"It's day 4 of the very intense boot camp program school. I knew going into it, it wasn't going to be like an ordinary school where you are the student and you have the teacher you. Which I was fine with. I knew the whole point was to go in person and ask your peers for help and help them as you work through projects. \n\nWe're given a project book with an example that we must recreate to pass. My problem is the materials they give us explain absolutely nothing and make it seem so complicated. The \"teachers\" can't tell you anything about anything you have to figure it out yourself. \n\nI have some background in computer science and basic knowledge of knowing to code frontend with like python, and html. I passed all my exams with high grades and I'm very studious. But right now with how everything is done in this school I'm feeling overwhelmed and way in over my head. \n\nI'm sat at the school for at least 12hrs everyday when possible since the campus is open 24/7 and you set your own schedule, just have to be on time for exams. Yet I've never felt quite so dumb in my life. \n\nI could really use help about now because I'm drowning and understand nothing. \n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: It's the next day and I'm grateful for everyone's advice on my situation. I was definitely feeling stressed and not having a good day yesterday with nothing going quite right. But it's a new day and reading everyone's advice has helped me put things into perspective and calm down. So thank you everyone.\n\nI'm honestly not even going to think about the exam that's today. I'm going to look into vscode like everyone recommended and definitely try to pick at as many brains as possible. \n\nI have messaged about English versions of the pdf files that have the projects for us to do, since I struggle with my second language still. \n\nMy life motto is \"one day or day one?\" So let's keep going. Thank you everyone. \n\n\n\n\n\nEdit2: I have entered the exam and failed within the first 10 minutes because I couldn't login into the exam (if you've done the 42 piscine you'll know what I mean). But I'm not in despair or anything because I stay afterwards and talked to my peers and figured out where I went wrong and what my mistake was. (It was a really small mistake of not subscribing to the event. I registered for the exam, but I didn't subscribe to the event as well prior to the exam beginning.)\n\nI know this isn't the subreddit for 42 (I'm already on that one too). But I do genuinely appreciate everyone's advice, tips and tricks. So I would still love to learn from anyone and everyone (treat me like a 5 year old and let me ask a million why and how questions 😂), that does include my peers at 42. \n\nAfter failing the exam and see who also failed, helped me see who was more on my level and that definitely gave me a lot more confidence to interact with my peers more. \n\nNow I need to figure out how to keep on doing the piscine and not sacrifice my health, because I don't think being glued to a chair for 12hrs is the most healthy thing, nor staring at a screen (I come home with horrible migraines by the end of the day). I want to learn without trying to drown. By the end of the day my brain is fried and I immediately crash out as soon as my head hits my pillow. \n\nSo please do keep giving me advice, whether it's coding related, how to interact with my peers better (I really struggle with it), caring for myself during the time period, absolutely anything. I will listen to those who have more experience than me.\n\n","author":{"name":"GoddessxTessa"},"score":107,"numComments":70,"subreddit":{"display_name":"learnprogramming"},"permalink":"/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nef7i8/decided_to_do_a_program_school_called_42_and_now/","createdUtc":1757612260,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nef7i8/decided_to_do_a_program_school_called_42_and_now/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895614583,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

Eu amo tecnologia e a possibilidade que a programação oferece, mas, na prática, me sinto preso entre altos e baixos constantes. Começo cada jornada muito motivado, estudando e explorando sem parar, mas essa motivação logo se transforma em frustração profunda. Sinto uma aversão que me faz querer fugir de tudo que lembre esse universo — abrir aplicativos, acessar materiais, até pensar no assunto.\n\nAlém disso, enfrento um medo intenso de não conseguir chegar onde quero. Questiono se estou começando do jeito certo, se não é tarde demais, se realmente tenho lugar nessa área. Essa ansiedade me paralisa e cria uma sensação constante de estar estagnado, como se todo meu esforço não levasse a lugar algum.\n\nA sobrecarga mental chega a ser física: já cheguei a estudar cerca de 12 horas por dia em alguns momentos, e depois disso tudo só quero distância do computador. Há também uma parte minha que acha que o problema é o tema, mas ao mesmo tempo amo psicologia, mostrando que meus desafios não são só técnicos, mas muito emocionais.\n\nEssa montanha-russa de sentimentos faz com que interrompa projetos, perca ritmo e me culpe por desistir, criando um círculo vicioso difícil de quebrar. Apesar de tudo isso, minha vontade de aprender e crescer nunca desaparece, e eu busco uma forma sustentável de estudar e me desenvolver, sem ficar preso no medo, na pressão e na exaustão.","author":"EchidnaDirect1256","score":1,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"learnprogramming","permalink":"/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nh6xh6/programação_paixão_medo_e_bloqueio_meu_desafio_de/","createdUtc":1757894366,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nh6xh6/programação_paixão_medo_e_bloqueio_meu_desafio_de/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895614583,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

It’s not that I’m particularly interested in C itself, but I do want to get better at coding in general.\n\nMy question is:\n\nAfter finishing this C book, should I keep going deeper into C, or should I move on to another language?\n\nWhat programming languages should I learn after C if my main goal is to improve my coding skills?\n\nAre there languages that are both good for learning and getting better at coding while also being useful for getting a job in the future?\n\nI’m currently considering either Python or C++ as my next language, Python because everyone recommends it to beginners, and C++ because it builds on C and includes all of C.\n\nThanks in advance!","author":"Otherwise_Load_8144","score":28,"numComments":39,"subreddit":"learnprogramming","permalink":"/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ngvk7w/what_languages_should_i_learn_after_c_to_get/","createdUtc":1757866901,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ngvk7w/what_languages_should_i_learn_after_c_to_get/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895614583,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

What logic could I use to make my program give the player the option to say, with a throw of 4, go back and forth to end up on the same tile ?)\n\n\n\nThank you so much in advance for your help, and have a good day !","author":"SeniorAdeptness9207","score":8,"numComments":4,"subreddit":"learnprogramming","permalink":"/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ngajxi/how_to_make_a_simpleish_board_game/","createdUtc":1757802247,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ngajxi/how_to_make_a_simpleish_board_game/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895614583,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1nfc6zh","title":"Where do I go next?","body":"Hi everyone! As a background on me I just enrolled in a CS Degree through WGU (literally one class done so far) and have been coding as a hobbyist on and off for about year now but I just started taking it serious within the last 3 or so months. \n\nI've put together a couple projects in Python Text based adventure game, personal finance tracker that reads a csv from my bank, even a small IOT like program for a fridge where I can get expiry dates and recipes I can make with the food I have, I even started dabbling in LUA bit making roblox games. I love programming and I want to learn anything and everything about it. \n\nTo be honest though I feel like I've hit a wall in my progression. I can sit on python make classes, dicts, lists, loop/control flow all day to make small simple terminal based applications. I feel relatively comfortable there. Where I am struggling the hardest is whenever I have to import a library for something I'm just super lost and I have a hard time reading and understanding the documentation especially when it comes to the specific syntax some of these things want. \n\nI'm just feeling lost and frustrated I want to turn these things I've made and what I'm going to make into a piece of software I can use/debug and add to not just a command line  prompt. Learning the basics of python was difficult initially but things started to click after working with it for a bit, but it feels like this steep cliff I have to climb to make something \"real\" now. I guess I'm just looking for some direction on how to learn the \"front end\" side of things and connect it to my back end. \n\nI'm a huge \"learn by doing\" type person. Which is really difficult right now considering I don't even know where to begin on making a ui/ux out of my stuff. I just tried to use streamlit in my IDE and just quit after slamming my head into the wall for about 3 hours getting nowhere with it. \n\nI just feel so frustrated. I got out of the military a bit ago and every day since then I've woken up at around 9am, sat down at my computer and tried my best to make something and learn more about python and programming in general. Sometimes for 12 hours or more at a time. \n\nI love this more than anything I've ever done and I want to do this for a living. I feel like if I could find some kind of internship (unpaid even) I could learn the work flow and talk with and learn from those senior developers I want to be like one day. I don't think I'm going to land that internship unpaid or not if all I have to show for myself and be competitive are some wonky ahh terminal based python programs lol. \n\nI guess I'm just looking for some advice on how to actualize these things I've made so that you don't have to be a programmer to use them. \n\nI really appreciate if you've read through the whole thing and if you have any advice, words of encouragement or some mean elitist put down about how I'm not trying hard enough please feel free to drop a reply or DM me. \n\n\nTLDR; I've got a good grasp on pythons basics but I want to actualize these into applications even your grandma could use.

At my university, our first programming language is C. After doing some research, I found out that C is considered a solid first language because it helps you understand the core principles of programming.\n Right now, I’m learning C through C Programming: A Modern Approach. It’s not that I’m particularly interested in C itself, but I do want to get better at coding in general.\n My question is:\n After finishing this C book, should I keep going deeper into C, or should I move on to another language?\n What programming languages should I learn after C if my main goal is to improve my coding skills?\n Are there languages that are both good for learning and getting better at coding while also being useful for getting a job in the future?\n I’m currently considering either Python or C++ as my next language, Python because everyone recommends it to beginners, and C++ because it builds on C and includes all of C.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Otherwise_Load_8144  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"learnprogramming","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ngvk7w/what_languages_should_i_learn_after_c_to_get/","createdUtc":1757895601.428,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ngvk7w/what_languages_should_i_learn_after_c_to_get/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601428,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":20,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":5,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":20}}}

I’m naturally motivated by tangible results, which is why I love coding I can see what I create. But when it comes to other subjects, or even “harder” coding problems, the process itself feels painful.\n Even when I break tasks into small problems, if I can’t solve them immediately, my mood collapses. I find it hard to enjoy learning for the sake of learning or the process itself. Most of my motivation is tied to performance and results, I want to change that. I love coding, but lately it feels like I’m running purely on willpower, not actual enjoyment, and it isn’t as satisfying as it used to be.\n This year in school doesn’t help. I have exams in literature, history, and math, which make it hard to focus on coding. I’ve even stopped working on projects because the thought “I must prepare for the exams” hits me like a train and ruins my mood. I absolutely despise literature, and the teacher isn’t making it any easier. On top of that, because of the Ukrainian war, I was forced to move and now need to catch up on multiple subjects because i switched school systems (I never studied Hungarian literature or history so I had start from scratch) and I don’t have a choice I can’t go to university if I don’t pass but the pressure is overwhelming. I'm not particularly good at math and my programming teacher university is 50/50 coding and math and if we are not comfortable with it we better get comfortable asap and I'm scared of math and I'm general school is pushing us hard and I feel overwhelmed. I've been looking for a tutor and asked my parents... Hopefully I can find one soon Recently, I had a math test and what devasted me the most is when the teacher put a \"logic\" question I couldn't solve it which is \"supposed to be easy\" which is interesting because it's very similar what I do when the programming teacher gives us a takes to solve, ex: check if this list contains a perfect square\", I started learning math from grade 1 on Khan academy, completely restarting because my foundation is terrible but Its not really enough. The rise of AI shakes my confidence in IT, hearing it might replace coders is making me anxious, if I really picked a good \"future proof\" career, which then makes me think, \"just study AI development\" -> a bunch of others join AI development -> market oversaturated and competition will be high to find a job in the future.\n I might be spiraling \n My question: How do you train yourself to enjoy the process of studying, not just the end result? Are there strategies, routines, or mindset shifts that make sitting down and learning inherently satisfying, even when the material isn’t naturally interesting and what would you do in my situation to \"get things in order\" I feel lost \n I really want to rewire how I approach studying and actually enjoy the process of creating and learning again.\n    submitted by    /u/BitBat16  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"learnprogramming","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nh24jb/how_can_actually_enjoy_studying_instead_of/","createdUtc":1757895601.428,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nh24jb/how_can_actually_enjoy_studying_instead_of/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601428,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":65,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":30,"contextScore":20,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":65}}}

Eu amo tecnologia e a possibilidade que a programação oferece, mas, na prática, me sinto preso entre altos e baixos constantes. Começo cada jornada muito motivado, estudando e explorando sem parar, mas essa motivação logo se transforma em frustração profunda. Sinto uma aversão que me faz querer fugir de tudo que lembre esse universo — abrir aplicativos, acessar materiais, até pensar no assunto.\n Além disso, enfrento um medo intenso de não conseguir chegar onde quero. Questiono se estou começando do jeito certo, se não é tarde demais, se realmente tenho lugar nessa área. Essa ansiedade me paralisa e cria uma sensação constante de estar estagnado, como se todo meu esforço não levasse a lugar algum.\n A sobrecarga mental chega a ser física: já cheguei a estudar cerca de 12 horas por dia em alguns momentos, e depois disso tudo só quero distância do computador. Há também uma parte minha que acha que o problema é o tema, mas ao mesmo tempo amo psicologia, mostrando que meus desafios não são só técnicos, mas muito emocionais.\n Essa montanha-russa de sentimentos faz com que interrompa projetos, perca ritmo e me culpe por desistir, criando um círculo vicioso difícil de quebrar. Apesar de tudo isso, minha vontade de aprender e crescer nunca desaparece, e eu busco uma forma sustentável de estudar e me desenvolver, sem ficar preso no medo, na pressão e na exaustão.\n    submitted by    /u/EchidnaDirect1256  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"learnprogramming","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nh6xh6/programação_paixão_medo_e_bloqueio_meu_desafio_de/","createdUtc":1757895601.428,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1nh6xh6/programação_paixão_medo_e_bloqueio_meu_desafio_de/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601428,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":50,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":30,"contextScore":5,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":50}}}

By effective I mean (ignoring UX for now):\n  \nSolves the user’s problem in a near-optimal way performance-wise (bottlenecks could be DB queries, language choice, or old code not updated for stricter requirements).\n Isn’t overly complex: logic is intuitive, code easy to understand/maintain, minimal moving parts.\n Cost/time effective: I almost always underestimate how long production-ready work takes, and the startup urgency makes this stressful.\n  \nContext: I’m a junior SWE at a small but successful startup (~10k customers, $1M+ revenue), no mentors, CS degree. I’ve shipped revenue-generating software at this company, but it feels sluggish and poorly architected cause simple changes take too long and my users aren't happy.

{"id":"1ngngk6","title":"Building the first fully AI-driven text-based RPG — need help architecting the \"brain\"","body":"I’m trying to build a fully AI-powered text-based video game. Imagine a turn-based RPG where the AI that determines outcomes is as smart as a human. Think *AIDungeon*, but more realistic.\n\nFor example:\n\n* If the player says, *“I pull the holy sword and one-shot the dragon with one slash,”* the system shouldn’t just accept it.\n* It should check if the player even has that sword in their inventory.\n* And the player shouldn’t be the one dictating outcomes. The AI “brain” should be responsible for deciding what happens, always.\n* Nothing in the game ever gets lost. If an item is dropped, it shows up in the player’s inventory. Everything in the world is AI-generated, and literally anything can happen.\n\nNow, the easy (but too rigid) way would be to make everything state-based:\n\n* If the player encounters an enemy → set combat flag → combat rules apply.\n* Once the monster dies → trigger inventory updates, loot drops, etc.\n\nBut this falls apart quickly:\n\n* What if the player tries to run away, but the system is still “locked” in combat?\n* What if they have an item that lets them capture a monster instead of killing it?\n* Or copy a monster so it fights on their side?\n\nThis kind of rigid flag system breaks down fast, and these are just combat examples — there are issues like this all over the place for so many different scenarios.\n\nSo I started thinking about a “hypothetical” system. If an LLM had infinite context and never hallucinated, I could just give it the game rules, and it would:\n\n* Return updated states every turn (player, enemies, items, etc.).\n* Handle fleeing, revisiting locations, re-encounters, inventory effects, all seamlessly.\n\nBut of course, real LLMs:\n\n* Don’t have infinite context.\n* Do hallucinate.\n* And embeddings alone don’t always pull the exact info you need (especially for things like NPC memory, past interactions, etc.).\n\nSo I’m stuck. I want an architecture that gives the AI the *right information at the right time* to make consistent decisions. Not the usual “throw everything in embeddings and pray” setup.\n\nThe best idea I’ve come up with so far is this:\n\n1. Let the AI ask itself: *“What questions do I need to answer to make this decision?”*\n2. Generate a list of questions.\n3. For each question, query embeddings (or other retrieval methods) to fetch the relevant info.\n4. Then use that to decide the outcome.\n\nThis feels like the cleanest approach so far, but I don’t know if it’s actually good, or if there’s something better I’m missing.\n\nFor context: I’ve used tools like Lovable a lot, and I’m amazed at how it can edit entire apps, even specific lines, without losing track of context or overwriting everything. I feel like understanding how systems like that work might give me clues for building this game “brain.”\n\nSo my question is: **what’s the right direction here?** Are there existing architectures, techniques, or ideas that would fit this kind of problem?","author":{"name":"Ok-War-9040"},"score":0,"numComments":2,"subreddit":{"display_name":"AskProgramming"},"permalink":"/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ngngk6/building_the_first_fully_aidriven_textbased_rpg/","createdUtc":1757844441,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ngngk6/building_the_first_fully_aidriven_textbased_rpg/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895616382,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1ncbdh9","title":"Game engine vs no game engine - which better from a programmer's perspective?","body":"Hello!  \n  \nI have been working in web development for two years and I had the chance to experience using multiple programming languages. Can't say I am an expert in each one of them but if there is something I learned about myself is that I love simplicity and control. I enjoy using high level frameworks and libraries but only when the data flow is not hidden from me.\n\nWhen it comes to building games, I was first introduced to game graphics libraries like Love2D for Lua, PyGame for Python and MonoGame for C#. There, I would write code in a full procedural style, synchronous code read from top to bottom. When performance was critical, I would use threading or asynchronous function calls. Big blocks of code would be well hidden behind functions (for example, a level could be a function itself).\n\nI tried to switch to a game engine multiple times but each time I got discouraged by the lots of design patterns the game engine enforces and the amount of quirks it has. I can't speak much of Unity or Unreal but Godot for examples enforces, through it's very nature, similar structures like OOP, an implementation of the observer pattern done via signals and events, a lot of callback functions and many more.\n\nFor me, this is the exact complete opposite from the way I was \"taught\" to program games. In theory, these concepts sound good but in practice I encountered the following problems :  \n  \n**->**It's like OOP but not quite OOP. In a simple programming language you'd create a class, give it methods and be in control when that class is istantiated and when it's methods run. In a game engine you have a blueprint on which you can attach a script, and when that instantation and script's run are managed by the engine. It's like you both combine the conditions and the behavior of a class into one singular place.  \n  \n**->**Event driven programming becomes a total mess when literally everything becomes an event. Compared to procedural code where you can trace code from import to reference or simply read it top to bottom and debug it by step by step, events can become much harder to trace.   \n  \n**->**Engine quirks that are not explained anywhere and you have to understand them the hard way, wasting a lot of time. For example in Godot when calling RPCs on the clients, any function related to the physics engine will simply not work at all. It must be called from an authority server. How does the server call the function on other connected clients without hardcoding some packets, thus defying the whole purpose of the RPC calls? Also, would've loved if this was explained in the engine and I didn't found this information after hours of failed attempts in a forum post wrote 2 years ago.  \n  \n**->**The most important and frustrating part, the encapsulation of the data or the isolation of the data. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy OOP, but only when I am defining data models or objects with no strong connection to the outer world data. But in game engines, I found myself in the situation of having to share data from one node or actor to another which is not as straight forward as in normal, simple OOP where you have getters, setters and methods to do so. Sure, singletons are a thing but when I run in situations where data is not ready and I have to build protection systems against crash for invalid data. This is indeed part of my code being bad, not saying it's impossible, but it's far harder to plan it out and debug - too many moving parts.\n\nThat are the reasons why I believe procedural, simple DOD-based code, perhaps with some simple OOP, is much easier to work with. Perhaps I am missing some bigger scale projects to see the benefits of these programming patterns but, in my experience, they are harder to implement due to how scattared the data flow is.\n\nSo, I am asking :  \n\\->Why beginners are taught and almost enforced with these complex patterns?  \n\\->Why almost no game engine uses DOD based architectures (like ECS or other) ?  \n\\->Despite being able to simulate a DOD pattern in a game engine, why many other experts or \"experts\" highly discourage this?  \n\\->What can I do to improve on these?\n\nThank you!\n\n","author":{"name":"yughiro_destroyer"},"score":0,"numComments":17,"subreddit":{"display_name":"AskProgramming"},"permalink":"/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ncbdh9/game_engine_vs_no_game_engine_which_better_from_a/","createdUtc":1757398615,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ncbdh9/game_engine_vs_no_game_engine_which_better_from_a/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895616382,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}
{"id":"1nc8kjf","title":"I am attempting to make a runtime static linking library for a plugin system and am concerned about two things: are there any libraries for this so that this is at all feasible, and what kinds of problems will I encounter for cross platformness.","body":"Edit: not a \"runtime\" static linking library - a post-deployment linker - changes would be made to a brand new object file representing the program and then that new program would be launched from then on, permanently.\n\nFirstly, please save a bunch of my time and let me know if this has been done before - I would much rather retool whatever *that* is into a library than try to do this whole thing by myself.\n\nI am planning on making a Rust/C\\*\\* library that will enable a program linked with it to use a static object file duplicate of itself to make a new executable program by linking to plugin object files. They will have a common API interface and will each be parsed to ensure that they never attempt to make system calls and cannot dynamic link to the rest of the system's libraries beyond a preconfigured list of allowed libraries. This should ensure that no matter what, a plugin cannot tamper with the system after being loaded unless it is specifically given permission to do so by. Furthermore, beyond CPU architectures and platform instrinsics, each plugin would be more or less OS/system agnostic, since it can't even link to the system's low level libraries (such as POSIX libraries on Linux/MacOS/BSD, or the Windows API.)\n\nI am pretty sure that this will work - most of what seperates a system to disallow cross platformness is just the system call interface, the libraries, and the exact hardware, so long as you retarget each plugin to the correct CPU architectures and the host program provides a cross platform interface to the system, the plugins will work just fine.\n\nThe big questions are as mentioned in the title: other than GNU BFD (I will get into that in a moment) are there any good binary format manipulation libraries that I can use, and are there any other problems I have yet to bump into that I inevitably will?\n\n\\* GNU BFD is in fact a great library for this project, but I think that mostly comes down to the fact that it is the only one I have found so far that actually has any cross-platformness. The only other projects I have seen that handles binary file formats are two seperate projects that both define what the ELF header file is and some basic manipulations for it. Other than that, it is very poorly documented (by the admission of maintainers,) it seems dependent on GNU Binutils in general, and there are generally many potential improvements that could be made.\n\n\\*\\* I am probablly going to use Mozilla's `cbindgen` crate for generating C/C++ bindings. The main point of this project is to enable systems level languages to be used for extending existing program a la Emacs and Neovim, so that it can be easy to add whatever plugins in whatever language you please without demanding complete recompilation each time. I know I could just offer dynamic libraries that get loaded at runtime in a specific way, but I feel that this would be much, much less cross platform than this aproach because I probablly couldn't nearly as easily manipulate a dynamic library to eliminate certain kinds of code. Besides, it just seems neat!\n\nAddendum: I saw Kaitai Struct while writing this. Still doesn't work for my project since the code it outputs isn't C (and from the sounds of it, [it likely won't ever be](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct/issues/263)) but I still think that it's a possible fallback.","author":{"name":"Public_Quit5942"},"score":1,"numComments":3,"subreddit":{"display_name":"AskProgramming"},"permalink":"/r/AskProgramming/comments/1nc8kjf/i_am_attempting_to_make_a_runtime_static_linking/","createdUtc":1757388988,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1nc8kjf/i_am_attempting_to_make_a_runtime_static_linking/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895616382,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}
{"id":"1nc5fce","title":"Event bus (global message) vs switch statement.","body":"So let’s say I have a problem in my game where I need a set of systems:  \n`ItemSystem`, `SkillSystem`, `DialogSystem`.\n\nThe player input will expose an event called `ActionRequest`, which tells the corresponding system to perform the action. I can approach this in two ways:\n\n**1. Base argument type**  \nMake a generic base type argument called `ActionArgBase`, then have derived classes like `ItemActionArgs` and `SkillActionArgs`, which contain data relevant to their system. Pass them into the `ActionManager` as `ActionArgBase`, and then do a switch case:\n\nActionManager:\n\nswitch(actionArg)\n\nSkillActionArgs -> SkillSystem(actionArgs)\n\nItemActionArgs -> ItemSystem(actionArgs)\n\n...\n\nand so on.\n\n**2. Event bus with command objects**  \nUse an event bus and a set of command objects that raise events with the corresponding args, something like:\n\n    public class SkillActionCommand : ITargetableCommand\n    {   \n        public IEntity Target { get; set; }\n        private readonly SkillActionData _skillActionData;\n        public SkillActionCommand(SkillActionData skillActionData)\n        {\n            _skillActionData = skillActionData;\n        }\n        \n        public void Execute(IEntity entity)\n        {\n            EventBus.Publish( new SkillRequestEventArgs(_skillActionData, entity, Target) );\n        }\n    \n    }\n\nThis approach is easy to extend since each new system just listens to its own request args so each time I want to extend like swim system, movement system just add each new pairs of classes.

I’m hoping with some good networking and problem solving along with working towards my degree, I’ll find something! \n\nAny and all advice welcome.","author":{"name":"Novel-Thought-2080"},"score":59,"numComments":37,"subreddit":{"display_name":"AskProgramming"},"permalink":"/r/AskProgramming/comments/1n7j99f/im_28_years_old_studying_computer_science/","createdUtc":1756916282,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1n7j99f/im_28_years_old_studying_computer_science/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895616382,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1n6h7ry","title":"Is there a name for how old code has surfaced more bugs?","body":"Sorry if this has been asked before, couldn't find a good way to search for it.\n\nI was explaining something in another sub and I thought there might be a technical name for it.\n\nCodebases have a tendency to acquire tech debt, in the form of hacks that were made to solve unforeseen problems and were never refactored, architecture problems that became apparent with time (or with sudden changes in the specs), etc. These problems make it tempting to attempt a complete rewrite, but as we all know rewrites are risky.\n\nThe risk is that old codebases tend to have surfaced a lot more bugs. That feature you implemented on the first week has been indirectly tested for a long time as you implemented the rest of the code. You probably found a lot of bugs even after you called it \"done\". Rewriting that feature from scratch means you're introducing lots of new bugs that have not had time to \"surface\", like the bugs from the first implementation did.\n\nTherefore even as code worsens with time due to the tech debt it also improves with time, due to bugs being surfaced and fixed.\n\nSo anyways, I was trying to explain this and I thought someone has probably explained it better before and given it a name. Is it the case?\n\nWhat I want mostly is a concept I can bring up when someone proposes a rewrite and I think it's a bad idea for the aforementioned reasons lol\n\nPD: I know test suite together with encapsulation/good architecture would solve about 99% of this, but we all know tests don't cover everything, if they exist at all, and if you are given 1 day to fix a hot issue you're probably not going to have the time or the energy to write a test that covers that bug just in case it happens in the future.","author":{"name":"carllacan"},"score":3,"numComments":30,"subreddit":{"display_name":"AskProgramming"},"permalink":"/r/AskProgramming/comments/1n6h7ry/is_there_a_name_for_how_old_code_has_surfaced/","createdUtc":1756813407,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1n6h7ry/is_there_a_name_for_how_old_code_has_surfaced/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895616382,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1ndjmgl","title":"What Do I need to Know how to code without AI? (Job Readiness)","body":"I cant go to anyone about this question because my internship boss might think I am looking for other jobs. My main question is what do I need to know how to do without AI for a job after college?\n\nI'll give some background. I am a sophomore (almost junior) in college and I have been at my internship for almost 3 months. This internship role is at an AI/ML company. My boss says that I can and should use AI to code and gets projects done. Is this a bad or good advice?\n\nI would like to know if I am job ready and what I need to know to be job ready. I have built a CNN from following a youtube video to train on the mnist number dataset. From there I used AI to help me code a python script to capture video feed using openCV. I then converted the video feed to black and white and reduced noise to help the CNN read the numbers. I then had the neural network show its confidence level and what number it is seeing in realtime on video feed. I also implemented and trained on characters that were lower and uppercase.\n\nI built another model but this detects violence. It uses YOLO pose estimation and captures 16 points off of a human body. I then trained this model on violence videos with augmentation, variance, and an 80/20 split. It can be real time or can be from a video then converted into a mp4 to show all position points and its confidence level. It's a level from 0 to 1. If it detects violence for more than 3 seconds, it shows an alert. This is trained on the body points of the arms being up above shoulders, people overlapping each other, and videos of fights. The model then learns that arms that are raised can be a violence detection and fast movement of arms can be detected as well.\n\nI have built a model for license plate detection. I used YOLO object detection and datasets from Kaggle to then train this model on license plates. I then trained another model for this YOLO detection to read text characters and numbers from license plates. The video feed is also real time and shows what YOLO is detecting with bounding boxes and shows the plate number in real time. I also implemented the model to save the picture of what it detected and saved it to a json file with time stamps and the plate detection number and lettering. Then you can view this in a http file to view the detection confidence, the picture of the plate, and what the plates number is.\n\nI am now working on a robotics model. I am using ISAAC sim/lab to train a robot with collision sensors, lidar, suspension, ackermann steering, force, and more to detect walls in front of the robot and move around them. It uses lidar to move the tires and their acceleration and turning to move around obstacles. I can get more in depth but long story short I know the theory and how the code works.\n\nMy question is: Am I job ready or not because I used AI to code these projects?\n\nKeep in mind I used AI to code about 90% of what I have described. I know how it works and what parts it needs to function and learn. I have coded the most basic stuff without AI like rock paper scissors, to do list, flappy bird, and some other small ones. I know the losses, reward systems, data augmentations, 80/20 splits, learning vs memorizing, sensors, steering, Adam algorithm, skrl, epochs, learning curve, etc. I know basic python but if someone told me to create these projects again from scratch without AI, I would not be able to do it. I know what parts need to be implemented, but could not code them. What should I know how to do without AI help?\n\nThank you for reading this long post and I appreciate any answers!","author":"JensenGames001","score":0,"numComments":13,"subreddit":"AskProgramming","permalink":"/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ndjmgl/what_do_i_need_to_know_how_to_code_without_ai_job/","createdUtc":1757523074,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ndjmgl/what_do_i_need_to_know_how_to_code_without_ai_job/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895616382,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1ndbg33","title":"24M Career Crossroads: Should I Go Back to University for CS/SE? Need Advice","body":"Hey everyone,\n\nI'm at a crucial point in my career and could really use some perspective from this community. Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences!\n\n**TL;DR:** 24yo considering going back to university for CS/SE after dropping out 5 years ago. Struggling between taking the easy/fast route vs. making strategic long-term decisions.\n\n**Background:** I'm 24, living in Turkey. I dropped out of computer engineering 5 years ago during my first year due to social anxiety and speech issues(stuttering and stalling). I've been learning web development for the past 2 years but I'm hitting a wall and can't land jobs without a degree since companies here prefer students for government research grants and support programs.\n\n**Current Situation:** I've decided to go back to university and I'm preparing for entrance exams to study software engineering. Most people I talk to say that considering my age I should take the easier path. I'm considering a local university (15 minutes from home) where courses are taught in Turkish, as it would be the fastest path to enter the industry.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Software Engineering vs Computer Science - Does the distinction matter significantly for career prospects?\n2. What should I prioritize while preparing university? English improvement, algorithms/data structures or continuing to build web projects?\n3. University choice - Is choosing a convenient local university over prestigious ones a reasonable trade-off?\n\n**My Current Thoughts:**\n\n* Outside of top-tier universities, the institution matters less than individual effort\n* My English level is B1-B2. I can improve my English skills independently of the university (especially with AI tools now)\n* I've been focused on web dev for 2 years but university might expose me to other interesting areas\n\n**Long-term Goals:** I don't want to be another React developer, Web developer or X developer. I only discovered 3-4 weeks ago that there are much more technical and experience demanding roles like Software Architecture, System Design and Distributed Systems that seem far more challenging and rewarding. I want to take the right steps to grow and succeed, positioning myself for advancement into these areas rather than just finding any job to survive.\n\nThanks","author":"Vediacz","score":6,"numComments":4,"subreddit":"AskProgramming","permalink":"/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ndbg33/24m_career_crossroads_should_i_go_back_to/","createdUtc":1757503246,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ndbg33/24m_career_crossroads_should_i_go_back_to/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895616382,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1ncjk2v","title":"Looking for the name of a recommended programming book","body":"Within the last week, I was browsing various programming subreddits. I don't remember if it was r/programming  or r/csharp or r/dotnet but someone recommended a book on software application development, I remember that the book had three authors. I remember the redditor said that the book is a must read for everyone, even if you don't code in C-sharp/dotnet, because it goes through all the pitfalls of building a software application like \"internationalization\" and that book details what would happen if you don't follow the recommendation of the book. I thought I had the comment saved somewhere but apparently not and I can't find the name of that book. Wondering if anyone can help.\n\nEdit 1: ChatGPT thinks it's one of the following\n\n1. **Framework Design Guidelines (3rd ed.) — Cwalina, Barton, Abrams** Three .NET architects lay out “Do / Consider / Avoid / Do not” rules with the “why” behind them—very often explaining what goes wrong if you don’t follow the guidance. Although .NET-centric, folks recommend it across languages because it’s really an API/application design book.\n2. **Software Architecture in Practice (4th ed.) — Bass, Clements, Kazman** Also three authors. Not .NET-specific; it’s the classic on system-level pitfalls and quality attributes (availability, deployability, usability, etc.). The “tactics” chapters read like checklists of what breaks when you ignore a concern.\n3. **Microsoft .NET Application Architecture Guide (v2.0) — patterns & practices team (J.D. Meier et al.)** This is the one people often call a must-read for app builders. It systematically covers cross-cutting concerns (logging, config, caching, **localization/i18n**, accessibility) and explicitly tells you what to consider so you don’t get bitten later. Example text: “Implement…UI design, including factors such as accessibility, **localization**, and usability…”\n\nEdit 2: ChatGPT solved it, it was **Framework Design Guidelines** \n\n>If I had to recommend only one .NET book, it would be Framework Design Guidelines. Written by .NET architects, it’s a collection of conventions and best practices for writing idiomatic .NET code. What elevates this book from the rest is that it’s full of comments and annotations from .NET legends such as Jeffrey Richter, Joe Duffy, Rico Mariani, and Vance Morrison, in which they explain not only the best practices, but also the reasoning behind them.\n\n\\- taken From [https://mijailovic.net/2025/09/07/dotnet/](https://mijailovic.net/2025/09/07/dotnet/)\n\n>Every programming language needs this book. The essential design patterns will have to be updated for the individual language features and core libraries, but the idea behind the book is timeless.\n\n>Unlike SOLID, the guidelines are specific and justified. You can argue that individual rules don't apply to your project (e.g. Internationalization support), but at least everyone knows exactly what the rules actually mean.\n\n>More importantly, they tell you what happens if you violate the rule. Instead of vague expressions like \"clean code\" or \"maintainability\" they say things like \"If you violate this rule, this specific type of change will be harder.\"\n\n>It also tells you the cost of applying a rule to an existing code base. Because sometimes the rule, applied late, is worse than continuing to ignore the rule.\n\n\\- taken from /u/grauenwolf on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nap35c/comment/ncxfiap/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)","author":"Melodic_Slice_6079","score":2,"numComments":5,"subreddit":"AskProgramming","permalink":"/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ncjk2v/looking_for_the_name_of_a_recommended_programming/","createdUtc":1757426041,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ncjk2v/looking_for_the_name_of_a_recommended_programming/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895616382,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1nccjk2","title":"Ideas or tips for feature implementation","body":"I’ve been a developer for a few years. I'm decent, but I’ve never studied patterns and design. This is a gap in my knowledge I plan to fill in at some point, but for now I need some help.\n\nI’m building an app with a friend to be launched later this year and I have a feature that’s important for our MVP, but which I can’t figure out. I’m gonna try to explain the feature clearly, but part of the issue is that I lack the knowledge to know which terms to use for this, so bear with me…\n\n* The app has users.\n* The app has tasks, foreign key connection to users.\n* When a user is registered with certain “attributes” (the app is in the health space), they should automatically get a task every day for a certain number of days. After X days, they should get a task every 3 day instead.\n* New tasks should only be created if the user checked it off the day before (duplicate tasks should never be created).\n\nI’m stuck on what kind of architecture, pattern, or technology is best suited for this. Should this be handled by:\n\n* A background worker queue?\n* A cron job that checks daily and creates tasks?\n* Some kind of event-driven pattern?\n\nI also struggle with the right terminology to research this (is this a scheduler, job runner, task queue, etc.?).\n\nParts of the code are a bit unstructured, since we’re trying to quickly build an MVP, but we’re getting close to launch and I feel like this is a part of the app that I want to get right, especially since this is something that’s new to me and would be a pain to debug if I implement it without knowing what I'm doing.\n\nAny pointers to the right direction, recommended libraries, or common patterns for implementing this kind of recurring/automatic task creation would be super helpful. \n\nThe app is built using Django and react-native.\n\nThanks in advance, any ideas (or suggestions for books/guides on these topics) would be really appreciated!\n\n\n\n\n\n","author":"tocki4","score":1,"numComments":1,"subreddit":"AskProgramming","permalink":"/r/AskProgramming/comments/1nccjk2/ideas_or_tips_for_feature_implementation/","createdUtc":1757403134,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1nccjk2/ideas_or_tips_for_feature_implementation/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895616382,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

While I understand the term technical discussion can be broad I do think there is some lingua franca that eludes me that more experienced developers seem to have. For those who have been coding for much longer them me and occupied senior developer roles or something similar how did you study or was there anything you did that felt like a real game changer? \n\nI'm a bit hesitant to dive into reading a slew of books as it feels a bit like focusing on theory instead of functionality but I am working through the pragmatic programmer right now.","author":"NoClownsOnMyStation","score":42,"numComments":38,"subreddit":"AskProgramming","permalink":"/r/AskProgramming/comments/1nbzudg/how_to_go_from_ok_programmer_to_good_programmer/","createdUtc":1757365481,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1nbzudg/how_to_go_from_ok_programmer_to_good_programmer/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895616382,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

So I decided to invest some time in learning one low-level language, with the goal of building a terminal application (such as an image viewer or something similar).\n\nI'm afraid it won't be an easy task, and I think I'll have to invest two years of my life learning it. That time alone makes me afraid to choose something I don't like or hate enough to abandon it.\nThose are my vague concerns for each language:\n- C: it's like writing Assembly and you have to understand and consider everything before writing proper production-ready code.\n- Rust: it forces you to write code with its own mindset.\n- Zig: it still doesn't have 1.0 release, so it can change at any time.\n\nSo, my question is for the low-level nerd:\n\n**What would you learn if you started today and planned for the next two years?**\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nSidenote:\nI already learned Elm, and F#.

I followed it and just started coding without asking much questions.\n\nSome months ago I started doing a project using SDL2, basically it's a Tetris game. This made me use a lot of things my course didn't cover, like Make, CMake to make it cross- platform with linuw, using multiple files etc. \nTo be fully honest, even though I understand how everything that is in my code works, I used a lot of AI (I did not ask for code most of the time, I asked for what functions to look for and what the best methods of doing something were) and specially to know what the errors meant. And like I said before, there's a lot of things I did not learn about.\n\nRecently I started getting undefined references to libraries as errors, and for what I know, the cause for that is that my code is searching for libraries compiled for MingW, while I'm using UCRT.\n\nSo if I'm correct, the tutorial I followed made me install MingW in the UCRT environment, and that's not the same thing as compiling in the MingW environment. So what is the difference both MingWs ? And which environment should I use for my project ? \n\nSorry if what I said does not make much sense, English is not my first langage.\n\n","author":"Lime_Obvious","score":3,"numComments":15,"subreddit":"AskProgramming","permalink":"/r/AskProgramming/comments/1nbxith/what_exactly_is_mingw/","createdUtc":1757360177,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1nbxith/what_exactly_is_mingw/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895616382,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

Imagine a turn-based RPG where the AI that determines outcomes is as smart as a human. Think AIDungeon, but more realistic.\n For example:\n  \nIf the player says, “I pull the holy sword and one-shot the dragon with one slash,” the system shouldn’t just accept it.\n It should check if the player even has that sword in their inventory.\n And the player shouldn’t be the one dictating outcomes. The AI “brain” should be responsible for deciding what happens, always.\n Nothing in the game ever gets lost. If an item is dropped, it shows up in the player’s inventory. Everything in the world is AI-generated, and literally anything can happen.\n  \nNow, the easy (but too rigid) way would be to make everything state-based:\n  \nIf the player encounters an enemy → set combat flag → combat rules apply.\n Once the monster dies → trigger inventory updates, loot drops, etc.\n  \nBut this falls apart quickly:\n  \nWhat if the player tries to run away, but the system is still “locked” in combat?\n What if they have an item that lets them capture a monster instead of killing it?\n Or copy a monster so it fights on their side?\n  \nThis kind of rigid flag system breaks down fast, and these are just combat examples — there are issues like this all over the place for so many different scenarios.\n So I started thinking about a “hypothetical” system. If an LLM had infinite context and never hallucinated, I could just give it the game rules, and it would:\n  \nReturn updated states every turn (player, enemies, items, etc.).\n Handle fleeing, revisiting locations, re-encounters, inventory effects, all seamlessly.\n  \nBut of course, real LLMs:\n  \nDon’t have infinite context.\n Do hallucinate.\n And embeddings alone don’t always pull the exact info you need (especially for things like NPC memory, past interactions, etc.).\n  \nSo I’m stuck. I want an architecture that gives the AI the right information at the right time to make consistent decisions. Not the usual “throw everything in embeddings and pray” setup.\n The best idea I’ve come up with so far is this:\n  \nLet the AI ask itself: “What questions do I need to answer to make this decision?”\n Generate a list of questions.\n For each question, query embeddings (or other retrieval methods) to fetch the relevant info.\n Then use that to decide the outcome.\n  \nThis feels like the cleanest approach so far, but I don’t know if it’s actually good, or if there’s something better I’m missing.\n For context: I’ve used tools like Lovable a lot, and I’m amazed at how it can edit entire apps, even specific lines, without losing track of context or overwriting everything. I feel like understanding how systems like that work might give me clues for building this game “brain.”\n So my question is: what’s the right direction here? Are there existing architectures, techniques, or ideas that would fit this kind of problem?\n    submitted by    /u/Ok-War-9040  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"AskProgramming","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ngngk6/building_the_first_fully_aidriven_textbased_rpg/","createdUtc":1757895601.381,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ngngk6/building_the_first_fully_aidriven_textbased_rpg/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601381,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":50,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":30,"contextScore":5,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":50}}}

{"id":"1nfewvq","title":"Growing resentment toward a colleague/research collaborator","body":"I am an associate professor in education in the US. About six years ago, I invited a brilliant and incredibly likable colleague to join me on a research project (she joined the department one year after me). Since then, we have worked on multiple papers and grants together. Along wonderful insights, there has been a painful pattern. I have been doing the great majority of the work conceptualizing and envisioning as well as the labor between the idea and a published piece (about 90%). Even with the 10%, she has consistently let me down with missing deadlines, canceling or rescheduling meetings, not answering emails. For some reason, people often attribute my ideas to her - she repeats them so eloquently - and seek her expertise and involvement in things more than me. She took a lead on 2 papers in 2019 - they still have not been published. \n\nThe problem is I want out, but we are deeply scholarly entangled having \"collaborated\" for this long. Next year, she will also be my department chair. I am currently considering quitting a very meaningful project because I cannot take it anymore. She is technically leading and will be first author on this work - people wanted her to lead (meanwhile, I had the idea, invited her, and labored on the grant to make it a reality), yet the let downs continue with excuses everyone else seems to buy. Our project is suffering from her \"leadership\" and I have so much resentment built up that every missed meeting or deadline is triggering - it is letting down the participants as well. She is charming and knowledgeable and nice to people. I will look like a monster if my resentment spills out and I often question what is wrong with me - am I the only one who sees it? Do I walk away from this project (in which participants matter to me greatly) and cut all ties?\n\nShe also formally dropped out of a paper I am leading, so she is probably not happy either. She also mentions to people that she needs more time to work on her own research, as if our collaborative work prevented her from doing it (reminder - she put in 10% effort and time; she would not have gotten tenure without inflating her contribution and without these papers). I feel used, taken advantage of, and as a horrible collaborator who theoretically prevented her from working on her own stuff. What do I do? What perspective am I missing?

{"id":"1neumxd","title":"PSA to the grad students here about PhD exams and other qualifying exams","body":"This post is PSA for PhD students in the humanities. I am a faculty member in the humanities, and I have supervised upwards of ten PhD students at this point, and I currently have \\*feelings\\* about exam year, which is usually the third year of a doctoral program. I had some bad meetings this week, and I am exhausted and sad. I am not able to be as blunt as I would like with some of my own students because it would be unhelpful, so I am going to share some thoughts here. To be honest, this post is part PSA, part vent.\n\nFor many PhD students, exams year is extremely challenging. One book about Ph.D. programs suggests that it's the year most students think most seriously about dropping out of grad school, and that it's often the year that's hardest on students' mental health. If depression is a struggle for you in any way, there's a chance that it will hit you pretty hard during your exams year. A lot of students have a hard time due to the loss of structure they face after leaving coursework behind. Exams can also be pretty isolating, especially if you don't have family or a partner for moral support. Finally, the kind of work you're required to do is in many ways completely new. Coursework rewards depth; exams are about breadth. Perfectionism and detail-obsession can help you in coursework but then wreck you in exams year. As a result of all this, students can get pretty blue. All this is unfortunately normal. I could say more about surviving these things, but they are not--in this moment--my primary concern.\n\nSeveral times in my advising career, a student who was very promising early in their coursework ended up totally crashing out in their exams, not because they did anything especially dysfunctional, but just because they became extremely rigid in their thinking over the course of the year. Often, this rigidity is accompanied by defensiveness and inability to take criticism or suggestions, but this defensiveness is not really the biggest problem. There's a kind of a fork in the road that happens during exams, in my observation, and it has to do with synthetic reasoning and intellectual flexibility. Some students, when faced with the challenges of exams year, become completely inflexible thinkers, at least for a while, and sometimes in a pretty lasting way. This inflexibility is almost always a huge red flag about a student's ability to write a strong dissertation and seek academic employment. Others rise to the occasion.\n\nThere are a lot of possible reasons for this inflexibility. A lot of them have to do with mental health. Depression and anxiety can both rob you of executive function, and loss of executive function tends to lead to cognitive rigidity. Students who got through coursework partly by grinding also try to get through exams by working harder and amassing more coverage of their exam fields. The problem is that this obsession with coverage can lead them to spend their time in all the wrong ways. I recently had a student say to me, \"I don't have time to meet with all my committee members; I need to be spending all my time reading.\" That is the dead-ass incorrect approach.\n\nThe truth is, orals exams are the first task that you will face in the profession which you can't master just by being a completist. They \\*seem\\* like a task designed to get you to read and read and read and do nothing else. But they are really an exercise in learning to prioritize and contextualize. What you are supposed to do is to meet with all the people on your committee in a structured format in order to learn what your faculty considers to be important about the items on your exams list. You are supposed to learn how to follow the basic idea of the 80/20 rule in figuring out how to spend your time reading. You are not supposed to give equal attention to every page on your list. You are supposed to learn how to figure out which pages matter most, and why, and then use them to epitomize the broader concerns of your field. Some things you can skim, or God forbid even almost skip. Other things you should have nearly memorized. You are also supposed to be able to think \\*across\\* your lists in order to develop synthetic arguments. When you were in coursework, we, as faculty, did all these things for you. We scaffolded things. We triaged things. We assigned mere selections of some works and spent four weeks on others. We taught you to think flexibly about certain topics by asking you to talk about them, over and over and over again. We wrote interdisciplinary classes and taught seminars titled \"New Directions In...\" Now you are supposed to learn to do this work  on your own. It will be hard. It might be frustrating. It is ok to be mad or to feel frustrated or to cry. Crying and frustration can actually be a sign that a student is going to end up doing really well, because it's a sign the student is facing a bunch of intellectual challenges that they really care about and don't yet know how to master. It is not ok--in the sense that it is not going to go well--for students to become resentful and intellectually rigid and avoidant of faculty. No faculty member wants to meet with a PhD student for the sake of the faculty member's social life. If we ask to meet with you to discuss your exams, it is because we care about your future, and maybe because we are worried about you. The student who avoids intellectual frustration by becoming intellectually rigid is sometimes destined to write a weak dissertation and be disappointed on the job market. Many students ultimately pull out of this tailspin, but it is still a danger sign, and you should avoid it as a student if possible.","author":{"name":"Alstromeria1234"},"score":182,"numComments":42,"subreddit":{"display_name":"AskAcademia"},"permalink":"/r/AskAcademia/comments/1neumxd/psa_to_the_grad_students_here_about_phd_exams_and/","createdUtc":1757653950,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1neumxd/psa_to_the_grad_students_here_about_phd_exams_and/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895618625,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}
{"id":"1negyr7","title":"Beyond proctored exams: how are you testing genuine understanding in the AI era?","body":"Just like we've seen with law boards and medical licensing exams, researchers decided to test ChatGPT on economics. They gave it the complete Test of Understanding in College Economics, a standardized exam that's been used across US universities for over 50 years with data from thousands of students.\n\nChatGPT scored 91st percentile in microeconomics and 99th percentile in macroeconomics compared to students who had just finished their semester-long courses. What made this study different was they used the complete 30-question exam rather than cherry-picked samples, and they had decades of normative data for comparison. Sometimes ChatGPT did weird stuff like claiming all answers were correct, but overall it crushed the test.\n\nWe can go back to proctored in-person exams sure, but that feels like we're just running from the problem. ChatGPT isn't going away. The study authors mentioned pivoting toward experiential learning that AI struggles with, but I'm curious what that actually looks like in practice\n\nWhat are folks doing to test genuine understanding and original thinking beyond just making students sit in a room without internet? I've been experimenting with having students explain their reasoning out loud, or asking them to connect concepts to their personal experiences, but I'm looking for more ideas that do not require me to spend more time on evaluations.\n\nThe researchers pointed out that traditional plagiarism detection is useless here since ChatGPT generates original content. They're seeing this as fundamentally different from copy-paste cheating. Are people having students work through problems in real-time during office hours? Group projects where individual contributions are more visible? Most of these solutions take more time away from research or wastage of time during class hours, which is not ideal.\n\nReally interested in hearing what's working for people who are further along in figuring this out.\n\nFull study for anyone interested: Geerling, W., Mateer, G.

The project is a specialization of cell culture that I really want to get experience with before I go on to do bigger projects for different and well-established institutions. The problem is my professor leading the project is also the PI and in a recent lecture, he claimed that HIV doesn’t cause AIDS and called it “propaganda.” He’s an MD/PhD, however he doesn’t practice, and doesn’t have any substantial literature or body of work (little to none). It made me very uncomfortable. There’s no one else at the university who does culture work, so it’s not like I can just switch labs. I even applied to a scholarship/grant to fund the project. I haven’t started the project yet, and I’m stuck between: \n-Starting the project just to gain the tissue culture skills and finish a poster, then quietly move on, \n-Or walk away entirely to avoid any association with a PI who spreads dangerous misinformation. Would it be naive to go ahead with the project anyway just to gain the experience and then leave?

It’s volunteer hours so (~4-6 hours) and at most would present a poster at the university’s research conference. Also, I’m not looking for a LOR from them since I have different substantial work with another professor.  Additionally, my university is first and foremost a teaching institution, so my specific role would be to develop 3D cell culture models to be used in the lab so that students can be familiarized with such techniques for their future careers. If I were to leave then this role would go to someone else, but I would really like to help fellow students enrich their laboratory experiences. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

{"id":"1ndh85q","title":"Looking for feedback about requesting published data/results from authors","body":"Thanks for reading. I will try to be as detailed but brief as possible.\n\nLast Spring, I requested results from an authorship team for six of their published studies (years published 2001 – 2024). The results are for a meta-analysis that I am conducting on the effectiveness of a medical treatment, and these six studies met my inclusion criteria. The problem was that all six studies did not report the necessary results for me to conduct the meta-analysis; means and standard deviations of the outcomes in their study conditions. These results are standard to report in my field. Of the 20 studies meeting my inclusion criteria, only this authorship team and the authors of two other studies did not report these results (the authors of the two other studies all happily agreed to provide their results).\n\nMy initial request from the authors was ignored, so I sent a follow up email two weeks later. I received a response from the senior author almost immediately that explained they could not supply the results because it would take very long to find the data; of course, some of the studies were over 20 years old. I thanked the senior author and stated that I was confused why it would take so long because he was actively publishing with these studies. From 2020-2025, I have found at least 10 published secondary analyses that combine those six studies. Out of respect for the authors’ time, I have searched those secondary analyses for the results I needed, but none reported the results. The senior author then indicated that he would need a data share agreement from his university, which he described as a lengthy and difficult process. I replied that I did not understand how a data share agreement was necessary because I was technically requesting results – not data – of his published studies. This exchange ended with a statement from the senior author that he was currently busy and would get around to processing my request in the Fall.\n\nIt is now the Fall and I emailed the authorship team again to ask their progress on processing my request. Within minutes, I received an email from a different author on the team who stated that “surely I would provide some funding for them to process this request.” I replied that I understood that it takes time to process my request and I was prepared to offer $250 USD for the results because I have a grant to do this work. I also stated that, while I was willing to pay for their time, I remained confused why the process would take so long because the authors were actively publishing from these studies in 2025 (including multiple meta-analyses which have the exact information that I need). I also shared how many of the published secondary analyses contain statements that “Data will be furnished upon a reasonable request.” I have not heard from any of the authors in several weeks.\n\nI have consulted with several trusted colleagues about this situation and how to proceed, but I am interested to hear the thoughts from a broader audience. Let me know what you think!","author":{"name":"rapfund"},"score":5,"numComments":2,"subreddit":{"display_name":"AskAcademia"},"permalink":"/r/AskAcademia/comments/1ndh85q/looking_for_feedback_about_requesting_published/","createdUtc":1757517873,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1ndh85q/looking_for_feedback_about_requesting_published/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895618625,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1nb2x9r","title":"Is academia running out of \"useful research\"?","body":"Academia operates on the assumption that **there exists unlimited amount of hidden knowledge just sitting somewhere waiting to be discovered/researched/published.** Indeed, I think you can easily come up with a research paper or direction that no one has thought up yet, especially something that overlaps between multiple fields, such as \\[the ethics of using dolphin-shaped robots for underwater basket weaving\\].\n\nBut I think what's missing from this assumption is **the amount of useful and practical knowledge is** ***finite***, and while you can always create new research and discover new knowledge, those knowledge are not as useful/practical as the ones that came before, because the useful thing has already been discovered. Kind of like the difference between oil and oil-sand, the latter is just not the same.\n\nI think many fields are already facing a lot of strain in terms of running out of useful research:\n\n* The most well-known one is physics (shoutout to Sabine Hossenfelder), where useful breakthroughs are rarer and rarer. Many theories are dead-end in terms of real-world applications and has been that way for decades. The Noble prize in physics went to a non-physicist for a good reason, essentially a big thank you for creating some more useful research for physicists to work on.\n* In sociology, many are still writing papers based on theories from more than half century ago. Michel Foucault is the most cited person in the world for a reason. Once these theories are proposed, there are very limited amount of alternatives you can propose. Functionalism, conflict theory, symbolic interactionism, systems theory...how many more systems of thought can people think up that describe society? Probably getting scarce here.\n* In computer science, once an optimal algorithm discovered, it becomes very very difficult to cook up another algorithm that solves the problem. That problem is essentially done, the mine is empty, now you have to switch to another area. But these areas/topics tend to be increasingly difficult to work with or obscure and applications are narrower and narrower, from affecting the entire world (the internet, information theory, Google/page-rank) to basically no one (complexity of Pac Man).\n\nFurthermore, the bar for obtaining that new knowledge is now much higher. Aside from the amount of money that you need on some research directions, I honestly do not think that one PhD is enough. I understand that PhD is meant to teach you to learn on your own and do research, but there is just too much to learn and our career lifespan (and biological lifespan) are just too short for that. I'm sure everyone who done cross-disciplinary research in a different area has suddenly found themselves staring at maybe centuries worth of research that are already done.\n\nSome research area are deemed to be \"completely solved\" or \"dead\" and professors actively discourage students to do more research in those fields (most likely because they need review centuries worth of knowledge to come up with something nobody else has came up with). From mathematics, elementary point-set topology and classical geometry comes to mind.\n\nI've also observed a lot of young researcher are now resorting to the tactic of just pretending that previous research do not exist and all problems are novel and hoping that the reviewers are equally oblivious as them. Willful omission in citation is basically widespread at this point.\n\nAll in all, I can't see how academia can sustain itself in the long term except becoming more and more irrelevant as the good ideas become more and more scarce and difficult to cook up.","author":{"name":"NeighborhoodFatCat"},"score":0,"numComments":33,"subreddit":{"display_name":"AskAcademia"},"permalink":"/r/AskAcademia/comments/1nb2x9r/is_academia_running_out_of_useful_research/","createdUtc":1757274589,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1nb2x9r/is_academia_running_out_of_useful_research/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895618625,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1n89qai","title":"How to inform my supervisor I'm dropping out?","body":"I'm about to complete the first year of PhD, but after a long consideration I decided to drop out. Now I have a problem, namely how do I present that information to my supervisor?   \n  \nI can't complain much, tutoring-wise, except that I don't really see him, I only contact the assistant profesor, and they can't really explain me the direction or the objective of the research.  \n  \nBut it's a me-problem that I want to drop out. Firstly, I have no desire to pursue academic career, not even research itself, really. I only took the PhD because it was an instantenous job offer and I thought I might grow to like it. But I want to work in the industry, being hands-on, not just read articles for half a year. Secondly, I've been living abroad for two years now and I feel my condition deteriorates. I just can't get over my family and friends being outside of my reach and I have difficulty living normal life here. I fell into a limbo of uni-dormitory, don't have will/strength to do anything else. Additionaly, I am haunted by the idea that those years spent on the PhD will get me little benefit when transfering back to industry, meanwhile I could be already gaining experience and start saving money with better salary.\n\nI would like to present those issues to my supervisor, but they seem banal and don't know how to inform him that I don't want to stay here. Currently I am looking for job offers and want to ask for a 1-1 meeting once I can secure a job I will transfer to. Is it a good idea? I will be glad for any advice.

I recommended rejection for a few reasons.

I recommended rejection, other reviewer recommended major corrections. \n\nPaper goes for second round, authors don’t make much of an effort to improve or try to provide a good reason to reject comments. At some point i suggested they should review relevant techniques (not my papers) in the paper and their response was basically that they are not going to because they are not aware of these techniques and I didn’t provide doi (i wasn’t referring to specific papers but rather techniques that would be relevant and I gave the name of the techniques). These refs weren’t a major point but isn’t it their job to research the field they are publishing in?\n\nAnyways it just came back to me for the third time but I honestly don’t think they could do anything that would make me accept the paper because I have a fundamental issue with it but clearly editorial will keep pushing until it is published.

If he thought a scientist was overselling their data, he would write them off—forever. (I won’t name names.) He refused to put his name on any papers from his lab in which he didn’t have a substantial role. I remember when I wrote my first paper about gel electrophoresis, I typed out a draft and put, on the author line “Jerry A. Coyne and Richard C. Lewontin.” I put it on his desk for vetting.\n\nThe next day the paper was returned to me with, among the other comments, his name crossed out as author. He told me, “Don’t ever do that again.” It was drummed into us that adding your name to a student’s paper was bad form, which caused what he called “The Matthew Effect” (from the Biblical verse, “For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.”) Taking credit for your students’ work, he said, was a cheap way to make a name for yourself, which should be made based on your own work and ideas.

When my abstract was accepted to the conference, I was told to provide an alternative title and revise the content in the presentation since I had technically presented before, which, when I submitted the abstract, I was in the process of overhauling the original paper already.

The journal editor responded that there is no reason to retract it.\n\nMy background is in immunology and on first pass I felt the study was fine. However, i ran the paper through an AI manuscript review platform and [it noticed something wonky with the statistics (see link).](https://www.reviewer3.com/review/r-T3R4XA4PSN/share?pwd=7AVFTCCd3ajrK2)\n\nOne of the reviewer agents noticed “the pervasive pattern of hazard ratios below 1.0 for many outcomes.” It goes on to state “This consistent directionality, including several statistically significant protective associations, is highly implausible and suggests strong systemic bias.”   \n  \nEDIT: I'm adding here that I revisited the text and it was true. This is just not possible, statistically speaking. Here's why: aluminum adjuvants are not biologically expected to reduce the risk of many unrelated outcomes across the board. At best, you might see no association, or a specific adverse signal if one exists. If you see a consistent pattern of HRs < 1.0 across dozens of outcomes, it doesn’t mean the vaccines magically prevent all those conditions, it usually signals a bias in the study design or data. I am surprised I'm having to add this, would appreciate if Redditors took to googling things rather than commenting out of ignorance.\n\nDon’t you think the journal should address this?\n\nAnd on another note, now that these AI tools are around, do you think bad actors will use them as weapons in the anti science movement?\n\nDoes our work need to be bulletproof now in order to be defensible?","author":"Silent-Artichoke7865","score":0,"numComments":26,"subreddit":"AskAcademia","permalink":"/r/AskAcademia/comments/1nflmys/i_dont_like_rfk_but_shouldnt_this_paper_be/","createdUtc":1757729429,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1nflmys/i_dont_like_rfk_but_shouldnt_this_paper_be/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895618625,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

I've been offered a position in a lab in NYC that I'm very excited about, the research is a perfect fit for my skills and career goals.\n\nHowever, the starting salary is $54k. I was disappointed to learn that other postdocs I know at other NY institutions (and even some in different departments at the same university) are earning at least $20k more.\n\nI have a few key concerns:\n\n1. Livable? Is this salary even livable in NYC? I'm trying to gauge if this means an unbearable commute, multiple roommates, or a significant financial strain.\n2. Negotiation? I haven't discussed this with the PI yet. Is this number negotiable, or is it likely fixed by a specific grant's budget? The significant disparity with other local offers makes me wonder if there's room to discuss.\n3. Long-term stability? Beyond the first year, what can I expect? Is there a possibility for a meaningful salary increase, or could the salary potentially be decreased or the position not renewed if future grant funding becomes tight?\n\nI'm worried about jeopardizing the offer but feel accepting at this rate could be financially irresponsible.\n\nHas anyone successfully negotiated a similar offer? Any advice on how to professionally broach the topics of negotiation and funding security would be immensely appreciated.\n\n**Edit/Update:**  \n  \nThanks for all the comments, they gave me the push I needed to talk with my PhD supervisor and senior colleagues.

However, offering this salary feels exploitative, particularly toward international researchers who may not know how unlivable it is.

The support from the department has been limited; my group is tiny, and colleagues rarely come in, so the department culture isn’t great. There’s also constant pressure to raise funds, on top of the relatively low salary.\n\nAll of this, combined with the stress of trying to establish myself in the field, has led me to consider changing careers seriously. I’ve actually secured a position at a non-profit research institute in the US with funding for \\~ 10 years and a possibility for a permanent role. From what I have experienced and gathered, it appears to have a much better culture, supportive colleagues, strong resources, and a much more competitive salary. I will continue to work in the academic community and lead a group.\n\nThat said, I still worry. I’m behind in building my academic profile after these two years, and I’m scared that I’ll carry this same anxiety with me—that feeling of always needing to “prove myself” to succeed in an academic role. Part of me wonders if I should move into the industry instead, where at least I’d feel more financially secure and perhaps less dependent on this constant cycle of external validation.\n\nI know I do not have a particular question, but what do you think of my situation? In your experience, could my anxieties be a reflection of being unhappy in my current department, or is my mindset not ideal for academia?\n\nEDIT: added some more details ","author":"Adventurous_Drop9180","score":8,"numComments":8,"subreddit":"AskAcademia","permalink":"/r/AskAcademia/comments/1nf820e/are_my_struggles_just_bad_luck_or_academia_in/","createdUtc":1757695085,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1nf820e/are_my_struggles_just_bad_luck_or_academia_in/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895618625,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

{"id":"1ne9pl8","title":"Going into academia later in life","body":"Thank you all for taking the time to read this.\n\nI got a STEM PhD in 2016 from a top-15 department. Not cream of the crop, but very respectable.\n\nSince then I've worked in industry - basically went to a small software startup, we grew, got acquired, now we are bigger, and I'm one level below the CEO of a ~120 person company. \n\nI absolutely hate it. My job has gone from 80/20 technical/other to 90/10 other/technical, with most of the other nowadays being budgeting, staffing/HR, dealing with several direct reports, forecasting, etc. The travel also massively blows, whereas I used to love traveling to conferences. I can't stand any of it.\n\nThis is not what I got my PhD for. Fortunately, the money has been good, and we were able to pay off our house and cars when we got acquired, so money isn't a *huge* issue as we live super simply. \n\nFor years I've been craving to get back to academia somehow, but my research/technical knowledge and skills have slowly atrophied to the point that I'm 7-8 years behind current research aside from the biggest developments. When I was a PhD student, I published 2 **really** good papers in top journals, but nothing since then.\n\nIs there any hope of someone like me getting back into academia? I have been starting to read journal articles, blogs, listening to podcasts to catch up, even reviving some of my half-finished stuff from grad school to see if there are an easier ideas I can work on. I'm also planning to attend the 'premier' conference in my field next month after being absent since 2017 on the company's dime.\n\nWhat would a path forward even look like, if there is one? Postdoc? Become an instructor/adjunct at a university and try to link up with other academics to get back into research? Try to publish a paper or two on my on in the next few years and go from there? \n\nI understand academia is in a rough spot, but I still appreciate any and all suggestions. If there is a better subreddit or forum I can post to, please let me know.

{"id":"1ndt47i","title":"Advice on transferring PhD to another University for family reasons.","body":"I started my PhD last fall at a medium ranking R1 university in Tennessee. My spouse just moved to University of Washington (very good ranking) from Australia for a PostDoc. My PhD advisor is pretty young (I am one of his first PhD students), kind and understanding. We get along very well, he knows my spouse is in Seattle and is completely fine with me travelling every other week to meet her and also doing work remotely while I am there. Now my wife's PI just suggested the possibility of me transferring to her university (but a different school because our field of study is different). I know a research lab at her university where the research has some overlap (in terms of the technology we use) with my current research, but the PI is a senior professor. Since her PI suggested that, I have been very confused and impatient and not sure what to do. So, the disadvantage of me transferring is :\n\n* Not sure if the big professor would take me, and even if he does, not sure if I'd get along with him like I do with my PI.\n* To know if he'd take me, I'd have to talk to him but he knows my PI (they're both well known in our small research field) so he might talk to my PI. I would prefer telling my PI on my own, but don't want to tell him before I know the other lab in my wife's uni would accept me.\n* Not sure how me leaving would affect my current PI's tenure. He is a really good and kind person so I don't want to hurt his career.\n* I am making some progress with my current research and am ready for my qualifying exams in spring. In the new lab I'll have to change my topic (Since my current topic is the idea of my current PI) and start over.\n* My current university has very lenient rules. The qualifying exams are easy (just presenting our research proposal) and if you can have a paper published, you can graduate in 4 years (so 3 more years for me).\n\nThe advantages:\n\n* I can live with my wife, we've been living apart since I started my PhD. We are also planning a family in the next couple years because we are in our early 30s, so living together would help.\n* Financially, we'll be better off because we're renting separately in Seattle and Tennessee.\n* Her university is better ranked (many people even have not heard about my university) and well renowned than my current university, so I am assuming I'll have better opportunities.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I'd really love some advice/insights because I am really confused.

Double majoring isn't an option for me right now.\n\nSince middle school, I've been thinking of what I want to study in university. I was pretty set on physics by the end of high school. But the summer after graduation, I got into a programming project and found CS interesting, so I hesitantly switched tracks.\n\nSo far, CS has felt underwhelming. I started off ambitiously. Took math courses offered to mathematics students and trying to attend physics lectures too. But I lacked discipline, burned out quickly, and ended up isolated and depressed. I realized I still didn't know what I wanted to do. I didn’t earn any credits in my first semester. My second semester was spent trying to recover from that, and I let go of the idea of taking summer courses.\n\nIn the meantime, I discovered I really enjoy proof-based math. It’s so different from school math! It made me question everything. I think I’d enjoy studying math long-term, even up to a Master’s. But when it comes to research, I find math PhDs a bit abstract and unclear. I read about peoples experiences and what they do after a math PhD. But I can’t really picture what I’d do as a math researcher myself. CS or physics research feels more tangible, more real. Maybe that’s why they seem more appealing.\n\nAt the same time, I think I’d miss the experimental side of physics if I pursued pure math. Tinkering with equipment, trying to fix broken setups, banging my head against walls in a lab... I enjoyed that in high school. Physics in both academia and industry looks so interesting. \n\nBut I’m also not sure I actually enjoy real-world calculations. I really like the exactness of proofs compared to the handwavy use of maths in physics. Math doesn't feel arbitrary like other things.\n\nWith CS, I know some of it is objectively interesting, but I just can't bring myself to care. At least notright now. Programming can be fun when I have a goal, but the assignments feel so dull, I want to peel my face off. I’m afraid that if I committed more, I might actually start enjoying it later, but I just don’t know.\n\nI feel so immature and so lost for not having figured this out yet. I’m scared I won’t do anything meaningful with my life. The only thing I know is that I want to be a researcher, to contribute, even in the smallest way, to human knowledge. But I’m terrified I won’t be good enough, that I’ll end up full of regret, unhappy, and broke. Sometimes I just wish someone would tell me what to do.

They had a detailed dissertation that I believed their advisor had approved. They were working at this university with their own office, and I sat in on some of the classes they taught. They were not a professor. They have three publications.\n\nAt some point, things seemed to become stressful for them, and they complained that their advisor did not believe in their dissertation, although they had already spent years researching and preparing. A few weeks later, they were removed from their position, escorted to their office to pack up their things, return their devices, and they were dismissed from the program. This all happened abruptly, in my opinion, and I was given vague reasons that seemed to involve plagiarism and an email.\n\nAt the time, I was in an unsafe relationship, so I didn't ask many questions and tried to keep them calm.

{"id":"1ndnxm2","title":"Why do some PIs expect everything while giving absolutely nothing in return?","body":"I'm at a point where I'm deeply frustrated. We're expected to produce top-tier publications with miserable salaries (\\~$55k), often in labs with inadequate infrastructure, with minimal guidance, and all while living with the constant anxiety of a one-year contract that might not be renewed.\n\nIsn't a postdoc supposed to be a training position? How can you plan a research project, or your life, under such precarious conditions?\n\nThe most frustrating part is the complete lack of empathy from some PIs. They seem to have forgotten that it's no longer easy to get a permanent position. The system they succeeded in is gone, but they still expect us to thrive under conditions they never had to face.\n\nI've worked in renowned institutions (and some not-so-renowned) in wealthy countries, and that's precisely where I've found the most exploitative attitudes. Despite having ample funding, many PIs still see postdocs purely as cheap, disposable labor. There's little investment in our growth: no mentorship, no real support, no job security, and yet they still have extremely high demands.\n\nI'm fully aware we're supposed to be independent, but that doesn't justify a complete lack of discussion or training. What is our gain in this arrangement? We're left wondering if we're just here to produce data and teach our PIs about new techniques, without any meaningful professional development in return.\n\nAnd then, here’s the kicker, their inflated egos make them believe that a few empty compliments or vague \"you're doing great\" comments will somehow make up for it all. Like throwing a few kind words is enough to erase months or years of neglect, lack of support, and exploitation. Newsflash: it’s not.

{"id":"1ndjb4k","title":"Professor said he’s never my advisor and department wants to kick me out","body":"I’m still a bit shaking writing this. Basically I’m a third year international math PhD student. Technically fourth year because I went on medical leave for one year. I didn’t receive funding from the department the year I was on medical leave. I’ve been preparing for the oral exam that I plan to take this fall. \n\nYesterday, I was informed by the new department Dean of Graduate studies that the PDE professor I’ve been doing research for two semesters with never wanted to be my oral advisor. As a result, I cannot take the oral exam this fall, and then it’s all too late for me and I should just take the master and leave. I was very shocked and beyond belief for this change of events.\n\nI remember myself discussing the oral with him, but I don’t have any written proof. I asked him once whether I was his student, and he said, “You are not my student now since you haven’t taken the orals.”I also remembered how he was saying that my research with him is important but I should spend more time preparing for the orals. When I confronted the professor, he firmly claimed that besides never wanting me, he has been only doing reading with me to “give me a chance”. He said that I was not up to his expectation and I wasted the opportunity he gave me. In reality, he’s never actively communicating, constantly absent due to family reasons and very aloof. If I knew he’s not going to be my advisor, I’d find someone else instead rather than suffering through his behavior.\n\nI was hospitalized three years ago for suicidal thoughts and has been in treatment ever since. I felt humiliated by the professor, and interrogated by the department staff who sit on both sides of me, since when I came into the room they just threw the option at me. I couldn’t do anything but cry at the moment. The department and professor’s attitude really triggered me and I had to admit myself to the ER again last night because I was getting suicidal again. Now I’m stable, but still angry at how they treated me.\n\nI’m currently looking for another advisor (just got one) and hoping to negotiate with the department again so I can switch my focus to applied math and take the oral next spring. How likely is that? I’m still trying to figure things out at this moment. Any comments would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: the school policy for graduation is 72 credits (24 courses), and the official rule for oral is you cannot take not beyond 60 credits without taking the oral. I’m way below that at the moment. I suspect that the department is trying to cut funding and talk through my mind so I switch to a master willingly, since they don’t have official rules against me. I’m willing to fund myself if the school cannot fund more than 5 years.","author":"Guilty_Session3313","score":74,"numComments":47,"subreddit":"AskAcademia","permalink":"/r/AskAcademia/comments/1ndjb4k/professor_said_hes_never_my_advisor_and/","createdUtc":1757522389,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1ndjb4k/professor_said_hes_never_my_advisor_and/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895618625,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":0,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":0,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":0,"freshnessScore":0,"total":0}}}

I’m currently a student at a U.S. university where I’m enrolled in a BA/MA program. I’m a senior now so this spring I’ll be graduating with my bachelor’s, and next spring (2027) I’ll get my masters. My goal is to be an English professor. I know redditors are very cynical about the likelihood of getting jobs in that field, but that’s why I’m asking for help. My questions are as follows:\n 1) What should I do in preparation to apply for PhD programs? What are they looking for in applicants? How difficult is it to get a spot in a PhD program?\n 2) What jobs would be available to me outside of being a professor? I know that’s my ultimate goal, but I also need to eat so if I’m not able to immediate break into the space, what are my options?\n 3) I’ve been seeing a JD/PhD program as a possibility. If anyone has any insight into that I’d be interested in learning more. Once again, I do need a job either way so it would be nice to have a law degree to fall back on. I know those programs are hard to get into tho\n Thank you in advance for all your help.

I remember when I wrote my first paper about gel electrophoresis, I typed out a draft and put, on the author line “Jerry A. Coyne and Richard C. Lewontin.” I put it on his desk for vetting.\n The next day the paper was returned to me with, among the other comments, his name crossed out as author. He told me, “Don’t ever do that again.” It was drummed into us that adding your name to a student’s paper was bad form, which caused what he called “The Matthew Effect” (from the Biblical verse, “For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.”) Taking credit for your students’ work, he said, was a cheap way to make a name for yourself, which should be made based on your own work and ideas.

I’d like to explore how I can merge my current academic background (especially in marketing, which has been the most inspiring subject for me) with this industry.\n I’m a creative person (I also have ADHD, which sometimes feels like an advantage in terms of unconventional thinking, but in some other times it can be very bad), and I believe marketing/strategy could be a concrete bridge between my studies and the psychedelic ecosystem: startups, research organizations, patient-focused initiatives, etc. I don’t have a budget cap, and I want to aim for excellence (all over the world). I’ve personally experienced the potential of certain substances to replace or complement traditional treatments, and I see how markets and data are moving. I would like to combine a profitable career with a true passion, without discarding the years of study I’ve already invested.\n So I’d love your advice:\n - What master’s programs, specializations, or experiences could help me enter the psychedelic sector from an economic/marketing perspective?\n - Are there companies, labs or startups worth connecting with now?\n - Any real world examples of people who took a similar hybrid path?\n - Any practical advice, resources, or testimonies would be highly appreciated \n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/ratchet_rope  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"AskAcademia","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1nh39kd/how_can_i_combine_an_economics_degree_with_the/","createdUtc":1757895601.43,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1nh39kd/how_can_i_combine_an_economics_degree_with_the/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601430,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":40,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":5,"contextScore":20,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":40}}}

About six years ago, I invited a brilliant and incredibly likable colleague to join me on a research project (she joined the department one year after me). Since then, we have worked on multiple papers and grants together. Along wonderful insights, there has been a painful pattern. I have been doing the great majority of the work conceptualizing and envisioning as well as the labor between the idea and a published piece (about 90%). Even with the 10%, she has consistently let me down with missing deadlines, canceling or rescheduling meetings, not answering emails. For some reason, people often attribute my ideas to her - she repeats them so eloquently - and seek her expertise and involvement in things more than me. She took a lead on 2 papers in 2019 - they still have not been published. \n The problem is I want out, but we are deeply scholarly entangled having \"collaborated\" for this long. Next year, she will also be my department chair. I am currently considering quitting a very meaningful project because I cannot take it anymore. She is technically leading and will be first author on this work - people wanted her to lead (meanwhile, I had the idea, invited her, and labored on the grant to make it a reality), yet the let downs continue with excuses everyone else seems to buy. Our project is suffering from her \"leadership\" and I have so much resentment built up that every missed meeting or deadline is triggering - it is letting down the participants as well. She is charming and knowledgeable and nice to people. I will look like a monster if my resentment spills out and I often question what is wrong with me - am I the only one who sees it? Do I walk away from this project (in which participants matter to me greatly) and cut all ties?\n She also formally dropped out of a paper I am leading, so she is probably not happy either. She also mentions to people that she needs more time to work on her own research, as if our collaborative work prevented her from doing it (reminder - she put in 10% effort and time; she would not have gotten tenure without inflating her contribution and without these papers). I feel used, taken advantage of, and as a horrible collaborator who theoretically prevented her from working on her own stuff. What do I do?

Yes I know academia.edu is gross in general, but this is low even for them.\n Basically: I have several published articles that I've uploaded, and for two other publications, I've just added links to the articles, but did not upload the files themselves. My analytics shows that each of my uploaded 6 papers (and NOT the two papers where I just have a link to the publication) was \"viewed\" over the course of two minutes, each from 6 separate locations (Ecuador, Brazil, Russia, a different city in Ecuador, Argentina, and Venezuela- and none of them major cities). So obviously this is some kind of bot/AI data harvesting. (Even if it's believable that suddenly 6 separate people across the world would just happen to be looking at a different publication of mine at the exact same time, my humanities work is in cultural studies on a region that has no obvious relevance to any of these places).\n I guess I shouldn't be surprised. The only reason I still have things uploaded to academia.edu is that I'm a humanities postdoc and need the visibility, it beats paying for a personal website, and especially if I leave academia (likely) I'd like for my publications to still have some visibility for people who google the niche topics I've written about.

I thought that (based largely on reading a bit of sci fi) getting rid of waste heat in space was a significant problem, making such a proposal a non-starter.

And why are population 3 stars theorized to have no had it (significantly)?","body":"This question has bugged me a bit yesterday and I was unable to find any sources explaining it. Every source I've seen on the topic of rapid neutron captures process in supernovae seems to indicate that heavier elements were first produced in this way in population 2 supernovae. Why not in population 3? Most estimates I've seen for the lower end of population 3 masses range around ~10-15 solar masses, at which point you'd expect normal core collapse supernovae to take place. All I was able to gather is that it seems to somehow relate to the lower concentrations of neutron rich isotopes inside these stars, as they were only able to fuse through the CNO cycle after leaving the main sequence (so not much time for these isotopes to concentrate). But what does that have to do with the neutron flux? I thought the flux originates from the collapsing neutron core (and I'm guessing it has something to do with the neutrinos emitted by the electrons captures there?), not from anything related to the star's isotopic composition\n    submitted by    /u/ComplexInside1661  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"AskScience","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1ndc0v9/what_mechanisns_cause_the_massive_neutron_flux/","createdUtc":1757895601.622,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1ndc0v9/what_mechanisns_cause_the_massive_neutron_flux/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601622,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":35,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":20,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":35}}}

In theory, since sound follows the inverse square law, it should be the same information reaching us at different volumes, and we'd need to either look for the source or move our heads around to narrow down the origin point of a sound, but I can hear a sound and pretty immediately know now just the direction it's coming from but the angle as well.\n Apologies if the flair is inaccurate, not sure if I should tag this as physics (being a sound waves question) or a human body / neuroscience question (being a perception question)\n    submitted by    /u/HardBoiled800  \n [link]   [comments]","author":"unknown","score":0,"numComments":0,"subreddit":"AskScience","permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1n9l99l/why_can_we_tell_the_difference_between_loud_music/","createdUtc":1757895601.622,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1n9l99l/why_can_we_tell_the_difference_between_loud_music/","isNsfw":false,"metadata":{"fetchedAt":1757895601622,"processingVersion":"1.0.0","relevanceScore":35,"detailedScoreBreakdown":{"keywordScore":0,"contextScore":20,"engagementScore":0,"authorityScore":5,"freshnessScore":10,"total":35}}}
